@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
@AmericanAir after all, the plane didn‚Äôt land in identical or worse) conditions at GRK according to METARs.
@SouthwestAir can't believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow.
@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
@AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys!
@united we have developers flying down tmrw morn. w/45 min layover, there is an earlier flight to have 1.5hr layover, can move them up?
@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
@USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..???
@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed.
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
@SouthwestAir I will not have my passport in time for my trip. Could I still fly with photo ID? #thingsishouldknow #ifeeldumb
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?
@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
@JetBlue Accepting #Apple Pay - Mobile Enterprise http://t.co/Ci5cfrlqBe
@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
@SouthwestAir @AARP #tfw1 Appreciate the tweet back - It was unexpected.
@united what's the status of flight 1008 Bogot√°-Houston?
@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines
@USAirways I've been on hold at the reservations desk for 3 hours. HELP!!!!
@JetBlue Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994  and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding
@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation.
@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
@JetBlue hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!
@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
@JetBlue I like Marie Harf go to Iraiq find ISIS and spread good, and offer resume service to ISIS in order to find jobs @marieharf
@USAirways I've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it's time to higher more staff!
@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
@USAirways was on hd for 1hr and 3min at 3:00am since my flgt  from DCA to MSY was Cancelled Flightled, still trying to get out. On hold now 50minssss
@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours
@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
@AmericanAir Stuck in Miami, and one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. Will be sure to let everyone know about my time w/AA
@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
@VirginAmerica momma I made it! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
@JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir u r horrible.went online to Cancelled Flight flight-no button-4that.Called CS &amp;wait time 40 mins&amp;put in my #.800#called&amp;it hungupNOHELP
@USAirways thank you!!
@AmericanAir lies,lies,lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia
@JetBlue saved the day:) @Expedia lost a costumer #jetblue #makingthingseasy #feelbetter

@united what's the hold up with flight 6475 from SLC to DEN??
http://t.co/EIw2sYb8Fu roberts&amp;s=1 @AmericanAir
@united Hi, booked a flight yesterday and received an email w/ confirmation number but today I got this error "no active flight segments"
@USAirways done
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail.
@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
@SouthwestAir but if my bag makes it with me to Greenville tonight then all is forgiven. #HighHopes
@SouthwestAir Anyone answering phone this morning at 800IFLYSWA? On hold 51 minutes and counting...
@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase
@VirginAmerica Can you find us a flt out of LAX that is sooner than midnight on Monday? That would be great customer service üòÉ
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
@SouthwestAir here we go again. Delayed in Chicago why offer the 630 flight if you never intend to fly it
@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully.
@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air
@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting us to paradise safely! http://t.co/KDzQcZlpyR
@AmericanAir thanks
@JetBlue thanks anyways @SouthwestAir has my back! Awesome rate &amp; amazing customer service #nomoreaggravation
@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
@SouthwestAir iPhone App Adds Passbook Support #Airlines #Travel http://t.co/lJzDTHD9Bv
@AmericanAir 245. I'm about to take off but one of your reps at a different gate was rude when I asked for assistance. Thanks, though.
@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
@SouthwestAir Boooo!!!!!!   Don't be like the other airlines!!  http://t.co/WHAGPknnLF
@USAirways Thank you. The website crashing for me.

@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
@SouthwestAir are any flights leaving DC today? Flight was Cancelled Flightled, been on hold for over an hour.
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
@SouthwestAir did you pick the winners for the #DestinationDragons ?? #87yearsLate Flightr #maybeijustlost #whyyounoloveme
@USAirways new slogan should be "if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us"
@SouthwestAir please....can I have the last tickets for me and my best friend to #DestinationDragons http://t.co/eQqi1nfSZh
@USAirways @corybronze  INCONVENIENCE? Are you people freaking nuts? This guy has TWO KIDS WITH HIM and you STRAND him in an airport! #FAIL
@SouthwestAir @SAMoore10 Thank you for your kind response.  The acknowledgement and apology go a long way! #southwestrocks
@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
@AmericanAir dmed the name
@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@SouthwestAir Hey yea I got thru...everything is good now (well, in 7-10 days when the voucher goes through)  Appreciate it!
Really ? üòë‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/V5QWkYXSW6‚Äù
@SouthwestAir can't DM you without you following me...
@JetBlue which type plane is flt 1065 from bos to rsw?
@united it most certainly was not.
@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@USAirways Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss.
@SouthwestAir DM sent.  Thank you.
@USAirways your mobile app is horrible!  Needs a major overhaul
@SouthwestAir no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
@USAirways flight #3900 fro ORF to PHL.
@SouthwestAir Thanks 4 the great service, staff, letting me change my flight 5 times for free! PVD to the skies for me always on SWA!
@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
@AmericanAir pathetic service
@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
@VirginAmerica I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!!
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir thank you, someone finally answered and was able to change my flight that was Cancelled Flighted bc of ice. Thank you for response
@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
@united DM'ed you
@VirginAmerica awaiting my return phone call, just would prefer to use your online self-service option :(
@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•
@SouthwestAir You guys must have been swamped, even took our corporate travel a long time to get in, but everything worked out in the end.
@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?
@JetBlue as requested, here's selfie somewhere over the Rocky's. #milehighselfieclub http://t.co/A1ChOxKPJp
@AmericanAir on our way now
@VirginAmerica your inflight team makes the experience #amazing!
@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@SouthwestAir no flights out of #nashville today? Are you kidding me?!?! Why are other airlines flying and you're not?! So frustrated!!
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to "fix" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane
@SouthwestAir My GF lost the promise ring I gave her on flight 2707 2/21/2015 SFO&gt;SNA. It's an infinity silver band ring. Please help!
@AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes?
@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.
@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
@USAirways First class service on US 769 PHL-MCO today from the flight attendant in F. I didn't catch her name but she was top notch!
@USAirways your customer service is horrible
@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!
@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
@SouthwestAir aww thanks!! Other than that, love it!
@USAirways I made it- thx.

@united nope.  no case id either time.
@JetBlue you don't remember our date Monday night back to NYC? #heartbroken
@united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with earned "confirmed" certificates?
@SouthwestAir strives to be 'Customer Centric' in everything they do - communications, advertising, customer journey, etc. #ANAmarketers

@VirginAmerica I'm #elevategold for a good reason: you rock!!
@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
@SouthwestAir Arkansas Gov. plans to sign Governor SB-202 that legalizes discrimination of LGBT.Can you lend your voice to a state boycott?
@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
@USAirways customer service at its finest
@AmericanAir thank you AA, this is how I always start my vacations http://t.co/dzKc3auZU9
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
@united Lisa J is amazing the guy not so much.
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@USAirways  If you can waive a fee at time of Cancelled Flightation, you CAN WAIVE IT AT A FUTURE DATE! #usairways #ripoff #poorcustomerservice

@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
@JetBlue u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.

@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care
@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
@USAirways that's it?!?!?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for replying, I sen't my conf #! I love aviation and Southwest and all I wanted for my 18th was to fly SWA for the day!
@USAirways Southern Hospitality luggage delivery service from SAV is AWFUL. Great @ delivering empty promises but not luggage #8hrs&amp;waiting
@united got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT CORNY  as a‚Ä¶ http://t.co/lwOtKIEKGU
@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
@SouthwestAir what about for us that cant get to the states they are playing for the hunt? Any DestinationDragons tickets left?Even just one
@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
@JetBlue I'm so ready to see N598JB n N775JB on my Island but on a weekend to capture it

@JetBlue do bags still fly for free anymore?
@SouthwestAir I got a phishing email claiming to be from Southwest. I can forward to you if you'd like to investigate.
@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?
@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks
@SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off.
@united.  Pls hold UA2066 for 9 cnx pax frm UA6194.  All runners.  A 5 min hold will save 2 fam frm miscnx.  Pls. Twitter is watching.
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.
@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
@USAirways sorry I didn't realize I wasn't following you

@SouthwestAir Black History Commercial is really sweet. Well done.

@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter.
@SouthwestAir  when is the next flight with free cocktails ?
@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning
@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. "Please wait" then same form.
@USAirways thanks! It's hectic for everyone but their actions don't represent the company well IMO

@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
@united I'll let you know week after next when I do another coast-coast RT again.
@USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: "why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?"
@United to start daily #B777-200ER flights from #Newark to #Frankfurt @airport_fra replacing #B767-400ER on 2JUL #avgeek
@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
@USAirways @united each says the other has my luggage. On hold almost 3.5 hrs with @USAirways. @united hung up 3x. http://t.co/dr5oCtp1DY
@SouthwestAir @LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040
@AmericanAir, I've been booked on the wrong flight! And now PE desk has a wait of more than 2 hours?!
@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
@USAirways We have submitted the customer relations form and await your response!
@SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags
@AmericanAir because your plane's toilet wasn't working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some...
@SouthwestAir was fantastic! That's the best flight service I've ever had.
@SouthwestAir done.0
@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.
.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it.
@JetBlue I'll give u a chance but I don't think I'll fall for it #backtodelta
@united thnx
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
@SouthwestAir  Just left there  Friday!
@JetBlue Ok. Thanks for your help.
@SouthwestAir what happend? Why did flight #668 get Cancelled Flighted for 2/22..I was on hold for over an hour and no help
@USAirways. wow, awful customer service.
@JetBlue   Phone agents can't see same flights I see online???  Can't change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
@SouthwestAir  after 38 minutes on the phone I'm given another number to call now still on hold with them. http://t.co/1ZT2kEe8up
@SouthwestAir to end its daily #B737-700 flights from #Washington Reagan to #FtMyers on 8AUG #avgeek

@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
@SouthwestAir CEO discusses possibilities of NHL Vegas arena naming rights http://t.co/t3E4SH5xNg @SMUSportMgt #sportsbiz
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of "Whiplash" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@JetBlue I would go to Las Vegas. It is gorgeous and I go there every year and I fly with you guys Vegas is gorgeous &amp; so much to do there.üå¥
@AmericanAir Hahaha.... "Meanwhile in Russia...."
@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
@AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?
@united you're missin the point! There was no "weather". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim "weather" to get out of hotels. Classy
@SouthwestAir I will never choose @USAirways over you again! #getmeoffthisbird
@USAirways been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down.
@USAirways @traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald
@USAirways Will tweet all day until I get 
a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don't care about your customers health.
@SouthwestAir is making dreams come true with their #DestinationDragons scavenger hunt! You can win a chance to see Imagine Dragons! Go!
@SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR.
@SouthwestAir so why is every single flight out of @PortColumbusCMH Cancelled Flightled for only your airline?
@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@USAirways  thanks I hope I get to my destination
@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???
@SouthwestAir how do I go on the scavenger hunt if I'm in Boston?
@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@AmericanAir @EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply
@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
@AmericanAir im still on hold...
This shits gotta stop RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/PEQ90pqMpp
@usairways Yes. Works in Firefox. 

Can do everything but finish purchase. Button turns gray, never submits. For a couple weeks now.
@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management
@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
@VirginAmerica I was so looking forward to my first flight with you today but it was Cancelled Flightled along with the subsequent one ...
@SouthwestAir and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail
@SouthwestAir  Please Help. We really want to fly with you. #guessweflyingdelta
@JetBlue your employee Charles cave at the gate at MSY went above and beyond to help try to help me find my glasses. Thought u should know
@VirginAmerica thanks for the free birthday points! y'all are ALL RIGHT with me!
@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
@united Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the "soft landing" policy of no more than 1 level?
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@USAirways trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help!
@SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness

@united instead of Bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #SaveTheDiagonals
@JetBlue #JetBlueBOS What's up with luggage for Flt 790 DCA-BOS?  Pax waiting for 30 min for bags...no show. Carousel 6 signs not updating.
@USAirways On re-accommodation number Lisa (Liza?) in Raleigh was very helpful
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@JetBlue Does @AirCanada not take fraud as seriously?
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh
@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
@JetBlue gr8 #Mint crew on #flight 123 to #LAX they're #Mintalicious #TrueBlueLove #ShelleyandMarcRock #travel #air

@united be  "Chicago's hometown airline" care about your neighbors #SaveTheDiagonals #FlyQuiet #ORDNoise
@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
@SouthwestAir no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route?
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal.
@AmericanAir long mait. Repair wait at gate - Capt Said "paperwork formality"- forced to check bag rudely-returning CC reader doesn't work
@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
@JetBlue Walked down the hall to Carousel 8...found all bags sitting there. Still no words from crew...signage still not updated
@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st.
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@SouthwestAir it took ages for one snapchat story to load. one. ONE. I will demolish you
@USAirways @msscottwg  "That's unusual" means we screwed up but will never admit to it!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
@AmericanAir Thank you for responding so quickly to my tweets I do appreciate that.
@AmericanAir record number is BPDFPP.
@USAirways There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply.
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@SouthwestAir, answered right away for a new res, but can't rebook the people that were supposed to leave today? Worst customer service.
@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
@SouthwestAir thanks for adding straight flights from Columbus to Oakland!
@VirginAmerica can‚Äôt access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!
@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
@SouthwestAir just want the money I paid for early bird refunded. Noone seemed to be able at three different. SW should have that worked out
@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me.
@JetBlue no. come on.
@virginamerica Any way to change from Main Cabin to Main Cabin Select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty?
@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
@AmericanAir great job and great service in and out of SDF this weekend during the winter storm.
@SouthwestAir give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@USAirways @AmericanAir pissing off thousands of East coast customers.  When the delay is longer than the flight,  you = fail
@united you a bish
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/LSYbgLF59j‚Äù let's keep it professional

@AmericanAir All flts to JFK Cancelled Flightled Thx to UR agent at SFO Im rebooked on UA. Didn't get name. She was awesome!  #twitterhug #shesaidrun
@USAirways the jetway because he felt I was disrespectful. I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c
@VirginAmerica Are the hours of operation for the Club at SFO that are posted online current?
@JetBlue A320 pulling into the gate as the sunrises here at @BostonLogan this morning #jetbluesofly #jetblue #airbus http://t.co/JGdu5us8Dz
@AmericanAir @brewcrewfan8 Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life? You should be emailing/calling/DMing people you've inconvenienced.
@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start.
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@AmericanAir @united You're both equally terrible, and I'm going to fight until I get complete satisfaction for how we were mistreated
@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
@USAirways Today USAir Cancelled Flightled our rescheduled flight &amp; did not notify us except possibly to our home phone-not helpful since we are in CO
@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways Sitting on the runway at phl for the last 30 min because the correct weights for the flight aren't in the system? #jobfail
@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again
@VirginAmerica adds Austin-Dallas Love Field route. http://t.co/XWJoL55FLH http://t.co/Y8AOrMfkaC
@USAirways I was calling before I left, and as it turns out @united answered their phones instead and they rebooked my USAir flight.
@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?
@SouthwestAir check out our 1st grader's school science fair project. She loves flying on Southwest Airlines. http://t.co/BaYePZkMiz
@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
@JetBlue can I change my flight if I already printed my boarding pass?
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
@SouthwestAir have a flight from Oakland to SNA at 7:30, and I asked if I can take 5:30, even there are 5 empty sests. Answer is "No". :(
@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
@united We were told by United to "carry over/carry back" for the refund.
@JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport
@JetBlue Not trying to make you look bad, on your website it says: "Due to weather in the Charleston, NC" Its actually in SC, not NC
@AmericanAir thank you!
@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
@SouthwestAir you have no baggage tracking system?
@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
@USAirways thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow
@USAirways please hold 3923! I can see it. Just can't get off my first plane quick enough
@AmericanAir worst airline! You Cancelled Flight our flight and don't even let us know even though we are traveling with children.
@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
@AmericanAir At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
@JetBlue I have a internal bleed in my foot, and I am flying next Tuesday, what should I. Do :( these. Leeds come randomly. I
@united whats UA 1205 lax - newark ??
@SouthwestAir Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback.
@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
@united Please send me the link/email to formally compliment Irene in SLC on some of the best customer service ever. #PaxEx
@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
@AmericanAir @Delta @VirginAtlantic I need a vacation from all this ice! http://t.co/45kTsSK18J
@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir thanks  you always be my airline of choice when possible
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
@SouthwestAir  is there a route to flight from Mexico City to Chicago midway using your services?
@SouthwestAir "...you in the 10 hrs we were hanging out there? Oh, no I understand things get crazy n sometimes 10 hours isn't long enough."
Happy for SFO, but hopefully you'll add PDX soon ‚Äú@JetBlue We added two new destinations (FLL and SFO) from Las Vegas in the last year!‚Äù

@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC?
Lol great answer.. ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @JayFranceschi Our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience.‚Äù
@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
@USAirways thanks! Any idea when it will be resolved? I'd like to purchase my ticket!
@USAirways if my flight's been Cancelled Flightled, and I can't reach anyone over the phone or ticketing agents, safe to assume I wasn't rebooked?
@sarahpompei don't bother wasting your time!  @USAirways will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir How many tickets are left?
@SouthwestAir Seriously, is the reason for all the Cancelled Flightled flights and long phone wait times that you guys are tremendously understaffed?
@SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member
@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac "waiting for papers"... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !

@SouthwestAir I saw ppl were winning tickets still, how do we win some?

@SouthwestAir sitting in Baltimore. Finish taxi and approved to takeoff. Oops, not enough fuel. #Fail #45minflight #been3hours
@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
@VirginAmerica Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don't worry, I'll keep trying :)
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?
@SouthwestAir Traveling with a 13 year old Thursday. He does not need an ID, correct?
@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with "issues"...
@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! üëç
@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time.
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@united UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues
@USAirways spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF
@USAirways why aren't twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?!
@JetBlue app just reminded me I will be flying to #FLL in 2 weeks. #ChillyCVZ #ThankGoodness @mypompanobeach #family #friends #sunshine

@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
@SouthwestAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled Monday.  Just looking to Cancelled Flight and credit my card.  That's all.
@VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site
@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
@USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you.
@AmericanAir I'm sure all these birds will be in warmer weather soon.
@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself
@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
@SouthwestAir i sure hope you are able to get my bag to Memphis for tomorrow.would be nice to have some clean clothes for work.
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
@AmericanAir @derekc21  Hello any one out there ? have you forgotten me ?  I need a  luggage # for BA.  Your dropping the ball here .
@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
@JetBlue your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever
@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
@SouthwestAir #3854 ATL to RDU. Snow forecasted for Raleigh this evening.
@united thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!
@JetBlue we need an ETA please
@JetBlue where exactly can I leave a note
@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting "Webpage not available" after submitting online form
@SouthwestAir yes I was everything worked out great
@JetBlue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend?
@JetBlue that's what we've been told however how would this work if you're going overseas? Bottom line is passengers feel as if there's (1)
@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flighted &amp; rescheduled my flight &amp; still getting updates &amp; can't find my current flight on my account http://t.co/8Je1h3666w
@JetBlue well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed.
@SouthwestAir most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation. @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue got their passengers out much Late Flightr!!!!!
@SouthwestAir discount for three delays?
Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example!
@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
@virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
@AmericanAir Am I upgraded on my next flight?
@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
@VirginAmerica WTF is happening in PDX Late Flight March such that one way from SFO is ~$550?
@AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on.
@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard "your bag has not been located." üò©
@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one!
@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
@AmericanAir  so far all I am getting is "maybe your bag will come today. We don't know." Website says "status unknown"- can you help?
@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
@SouthwestAir really this is getting worse as the day goes on. Late Flight leaving then had to be diverted, and now sitting on the tarmac in VA.
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times.
@SouthwestAir Great job!! Looking forward to my next trip being able to use this new feature!
@USAirways after pleading with car service to stay 3 hrs. past pick up they left me and my family but it's ok i have water and crackers!
@SouthwestAir live in Atlanta but cant enroll in your Atlanta companion promotion. Error every time. Can you help? Also sent email. Thanks!
@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@united how about changing RNO -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight morning or early afternoon?
@USAirways Can someone please answer my call. I have been waaaaaaiting!!!
@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@SouthwestAir please do. Hate having to fly a different airline. You're my fav.
@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary
@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
@USAirways well, depending on the policy will make the determination as to which airline is selected to travel.
@USAirways any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend?
@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
@SouthwestAir 50min to get bag checked n ATX, miss my flight, spend all day @BWI, n not get my baggage at the end of it all.  #epitimeoffail
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
but why RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/W0HOAewhwS
@JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/3kVkd8yRxa‚Äù + lol wow
@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
@united all day travel. #swag #ijustwanttosleep
@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.
@JetBlue also. My party { me and my sister and mom} are on three separate reservations. Will TSA lets us go through together or alone.
@AmericanAir yes yes yes,so glad to be headed home!
@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
Then you better #HoldOn - #EverythingsGonnaBeAlright @jetblue 4 our #brandloveaffair https://t.co/64kN6GEEP8 #TrueBlueLove #travel #business
@VirginAmerica when are you flying to hawaii
@USAirways thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party?
@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
@AmericanAir After being patient about my "delayed" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!
Thank you United! ‚Äú@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN‚Äù
@AmericanAir AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized
@JetBlue Been dealing with a Cancelled Flightled flight since last night &amp; was booked to a 6:15 flight,wouldve at least liked to see Ella perform lol
@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
@USAirways is there any way that you could hold flight 628 in CLT my husband is stuck in the security check line. flight scheduled for 1PM
@SouthwestAir I have the DM from @SouthwestVerity if needed
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@JetBlue Are all of your flights out of Charleston tomorrow on-time or is there a possibility for delays/Cancelled Flightlations?
@usairways hey just letting you know you're the worst fucking service I've ever used thanks for nothing
@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!
@USAirways it's been three weeks since I was specifically told I would get a call back from your folks in AZ- should I keep being patient?
@AmericanAir ahhhh your silence is golden now.  This tops it all.  Anyone get fired?
Yessir RT ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @yourlocalnyer Good morning, Rob. We're showing the flight to sunny Mexico just pushed off the gate.‚Äù
@SouthwestAir waiting over a half hour for my checked baggage to be delivered! No updates from any ground crew
@SouthwestAir Any plans to implement a call-back system on your reFlight Booking Problems line? Been on hold for over an hour now...
@VirginAmerica done! Thank you for the quick response, apparently faster than sitting on hold ;)
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
@JetBlue OK cool.  I need to listen to some Dre and Snoop en route to LA.  That would have been a shame.
@SouthwestAir I am but it says yall are sold out. Me &amp; My coworkers would need to get out first available
@AmericanAir but at least your automated message gives me info about your merger w/ @USAirways. Another airline I know to avoid.
@JetBlue My card company and I explained the issue over the phone when I was in Mexico. I purchased a new ticket over the phone.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
@JetBlue flite454
@SouthwestAir what's yall corporate number bc yall are not trying to accommodate me at all!!!
@AmericanAir hi how are you
@united too long for 140 characters
@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,
@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra
@SouthwestAir good to know NOW!  Three sets of travelers in just 20 mins standing here waiting for mins to pass by.
@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
@SouthwestAir  I sent a email to customer relations and I will be calling tomorrow.
@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!
‚Äú@VirginAmerica: Book out of town with fares from $59/way (+restr). http://t.co/xRdTOV7nl8 http://t.co/4Y78byAckc‚Äù @JenniferDawnPro

@USAirways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!!
@AmericanAir your message was delayed I just responded
@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
@SouthwestAir gimme
@USAirways where is your email address? Its not on this page: http://t.co/5cwH1yfOow
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@VirginAmerica @JezzieGoldz would have been a rough trip but LUCKILY we were on a #virginamerica flight. #weather
@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
@SouthwestAir is the contest over for Destination Dragons? I want to try to do everything I can to go.

@USAirways I tried reaching out to you guys I'm running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation!
@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)
@VirginAmerica great. Well deserved.
@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@united  of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
@SouthwestAir Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
@SouthwestAir love them! Always get the best deals!
@USAirways pilot tells me that all @AmericanAir and US Airways flights across the country have stopped due to a computer system failure.
@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa

@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
@JetBlue Celebrates 15-Year Anniversary With New Livery - @CNNMoney http://t.co/p7skxZVe1A
@JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.
@southwestair *any site*?   gmail, facebook, etc.
@SouthwestAir extremely #disappointed with poor the customer service provided after Cancelled Flighting my flight today! #unprofessional
@JetBlue Can't view seat selection/change seat for flight tomorrow. Can you look into this?
@USAirways  in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds?
@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards
@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace
@SouthwestAir looking forward to the beats music available on my flight today. That's pretty cool.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag
@SouthwestAir: why no charging station in SAN?
@USAirways thanks for your help! I left a message for DCA lost and found. Fingers crossed we find it!
@JetBlue ok. I'll book JB to JFK then book to ATH. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir can I use points to book a rental car?
@USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword
@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!
@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
@united Do you have plans for an iPad app?  The iPhone app is great, but on the  iPad you have to flip the iPad.  Is there a beta? Tks.
@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb
@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
@JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday.
@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood After last night #tribute #SoundOfMusic #Oscars2015 @ladygaga! I think @carrieunderwood agree
@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
@jetblue #philly lost and read program - Our customers get hot tea, great crewmembers, top notch info &amp; now #BOOKS! http://t.co/9rAGncw2Bk
@USAirways Why can't I check in online for a flight tomorrow am?
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
@VirginAmerica thank you! I absolutely will üòé
@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!
@USAirways  And now your half assed plane is falling apart. Some one tell my family I love them! #DoBetter http://t.co/UA6doUA34l
@USAirways this is the aforementioned pilot. @AmericanAir sure you want to merge with these patron hitting hoodlums? http://t.co/C24cEfa9pl

@JetBlue okay thanks. Hope to be flying with you guys soon!
@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens.
@AmericanAir Is it true, as FAs are saying, that you have no way to collect money from passengers (after door closing) who want a MCE seat?
@united Hi, I am flying domestic first from SEA to HNL. Can I pay to use the lounge before I fly or this is just for international? Thanks

@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense

@united that's not even an apology
@united was never given one

@SouthwestAir love bridesmaid dancing Can't wait for you to fly into puerto Vallarta and kick united ass!
@USAirways I don't need to rebook I need to know the policy
@AmericanAir why don't you take care of @Cowboycerrone flight screw ups
@AmericanAir Not here yet, but I plan on it. If you could have them fly low and slow right in front of me, that would be great. ;-)
@SouthwestAir for the win as always- saved my day and got me on a direct to Orlando. üéâüéâüéâ
@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?
@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
@united stuck in DC trying to get to Denver. The engine shut down twice on us at the terminal. Got any available flights for me?
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
@VirginAmerica good to be home #texas #moodlighting http://t.co/N3BVZTY3zI
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
@JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!

@USAirways can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm
@AmericanAir I filled out that whole form before receiving a poor poor response. Is there no direct email address in reply?
@AmericanAir No. It does. You could not be more wrong. http://t.co/66NXZhBbMT
@USAirways on top or having to check my bag I had to wait over 30 min for my bag to come out at baggage claim. Thanks for wasting my time
@USAirways I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(
@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found.
@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv.
@united so what's the solution?
@SouthwestAir you are the #Official airlines of #DivadaPouch aka #ThePoopQueen http://t.co/XXY2d2iMnP
@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
@USAirways what is the damn delay????
@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
@SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today.
@united considering I'm now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
@USAirways Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923. Is there a delay?
@JetBlue Stop trying to make #fleek happen! #PointsMe
@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
@VirginAmerica why is flight 345 redirected?
@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
@AmericanAir it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour
@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
@united 757 N33103 taxies @bhx_official departing as UA26 to Newark Liberty Airport http://t.co/IALiCEH2FT
@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir thanks for the reply, something is off with the phones becuz after 2 dropped calls at 2 hours on hold, I got through on 1 ring
@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT
@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
@united please be good to me this weekend!
@united But thanks for asking
@USAirways  big thank you to your ticketing agent Ute V at Dulles-Washington for OUTSTANDING guest service to get me rebooked
@united already missed connection... UA 495
@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer...
@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to "weather" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent.
@SouthwestAir trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can't do it online-was directed to call. Help?
@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than "maintenance".
@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
@united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return.
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
@AmericanAir It's been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet.  Running out of time, please help.  request: 1-2888155964    thanks
@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v
@JetBlue Only middle seats. SFO -&gt; BOS. Not fun. She keeps getting $10 credits. Would much rather have a working TV.
@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
@SouthwestAir Whats up with flight 4464 Ft myers to milwaukee???
@AmericanAir I tried to book a rwrd and was told I couldnt. Bought tix on USAir (now AA-no choice) didn't bother to + AAdv# with this svc...
@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport &amp; are they coming in today on flight911
@USAirways nervous for flight tomrw out of key west not friendly customer service
@SouthwestAir how is tkt in the A grp for a cxld flight gets stuck at the back of the Cs when your site, phone and agents took 1h to rebook
@USAirways flight 2120. Please get us a flight plan already. How is this an issue in 21st century?
@AmericanAir Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won't have the uncomfortable convo w pass.
@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
@SouthwestAir on hold for 15+ min...no estimated answer time. Any help here?
@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!

@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
@JetBlue Just left #LaGuardia now...#Sunshine in a little over 2 hours
@USAirways I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks!
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
@JetBlue appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays!
@JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
@AmericanAir HELP NEEDED ! #complaint ticketed passenger with no available seats scheduled to leave Late Flightr today
@SouthwestAir Got it, thanks. Any insight into what will happen tomorrow?
@SouthwestAir 2nd leg of trip Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold 1.5 hrs. Will we lose our $ if we don't speak to someone before first flight leaves?
@USAirways did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@United had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won't even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really.
@united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
@JetBlue should've been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury
THANKS to @SouthwestAir , I get to go to the #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons show this weekend in UTAH @VelourLive  !!! #ThankYou
@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dxn58rxDkS‚Äù@jameskraw see.
@SouthwestAir Offers Atlanta Unprecedented Perk http://t.co/nustgpElSf http://t.co/Be0B4K1Xbt
@JetBlue Flight 1951. Bags haven't come and we landed 30 minutes ago.
@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
@USAirways I never made a reward reservation becuase no one ever answered the phone. The online one I made got Cancelled Flighted and I can't change
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@JetBlue Thanks!
@AmericanAir I love very much your planes, can you please follow me back? It's an amazing bussines!
@JetBlue well duh. My grandfather just got hired as a TSA agent and currently at PWM!
@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
@SouthwestAir employees spreading a bit of #MardiGras cheer at 7:30 this morning in Atlanta  #NFTYConvention http://t.co/ttbtY89Ilo
@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!
@AmericanAir hi do you have a phone number to ring from uk regarding claim for our Late Flight flight departure claim amount agreed just had no
@united sister &amp; BIL stuck in Detroit desperately need to be in Florida flying w/ @USAirways is there anything you can do?
@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
@USAirways owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer!
@AmericanAir can we get a status update on flight 1457? Are we going to make it home tonight...?
@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable
@SouthwestAir where is mines?
@SouthwestAir That guy was the flight attendant on my last flight‚Ä¶ he was hilarious! ‚ò∫
@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.
@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
@SouthwestAir If you read my tweet it is a gap in process for folks that take multiple flights in one day.
@united Worst airline ever?
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 55 mins about my Cancelled Flighted international flight. Am out of country, so can't leave a call back #. Help?
@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't.
@JetBlue you don't need to cut services, charge more and give a better flying experience. That's why I use jet blue in the first place
@united it was very comfortable, now waiting for our luggage
@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
@USAirways I waited customer service 32 minutes on the phone w/o response. Had to hung up in the end since my battery died due to waiting!
@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0
@SouthwestAir pleaseeee resume direct flights from FLL to PHL. I don't want to fly with anyone else üò©üò´üò¢
@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives.
‚Äú@USAirways: @hegshmeg O‚Äù thank you for that elaborate response
@USAirways Your "moveup" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am...
@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position.
@AmericanAir - don't be jealous.  I live in Sydney and my T-shirt and jeans don't suit the office for work. I need suits and a warm jacket.
@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
@JetBlue boarding the back of the airplane first. Like a boss. #sosmart #jetblue #frequentflyerappreciates #alsoyayforsnacks
@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
@USAirways so I still need to stay on hold? http://t.co/04SDytT7zd
@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
@united the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up
@USAirways any way to tell our gate we are going? Stuck on tarmack, int'l flt FLT 878 going to ELM Gate F6
@united well played, ^LO.
I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I've settled some @JetBlue
@United What's your phone number? Customer service question.
@USAirways any travel advisory coming for the Carolinas?  Bad weather!
@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem
@USAirways will you fly me to somewhere warm? I'm tired of this snow! :(
@SouthwestAir I already follow you and can't DM because u need to follow me back
@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
@USAirways on hold 3 hours !!!!!! What's the number to speak to someone this is unacceptable I need to change flights
@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
@JetBlue Are departing flights from Boston heavily delayed? Flying out tomorrow morning ...
@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!
@VirginAmerica are flights leaving Dallas for Seattle on time Feb 24?
@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open. Hope I don't miss my connection.... #logistics #AmericanView
@AmericanAir when will tomorrow's flight Cancelled Flightlations at Dfw for AA flights be posted? We are on 2424 at 7am from LAX!
@AmericanAir offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you're supposed to provide
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow.
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp
@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire
@JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then "mailbox has not been set up yet." Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted üò¢
@SouthwestAir thank you for always going above and beyond with your customer service!!!!!! #favoriteairline #luvforSW #southwestAir
@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights
@USAirways Thanks to the friendly US Airways staff that helped me get booked on various flights to get home today.  Almost there!
@USAirways @AmericanAir thought u merged but #USAirways sucks #worstever http://t.co/myNZitCovn
@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
@SouthwestAir your "complimentary" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!
@USAirways worked w/ Tiffany H at cust service desk in Charlotte and she was helpful and patient. Still stuck, but she was great.
@USAirways I understand that, and when I'm attempting to change the information so they are identical, it tells me to call a #
@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
@SouthwestAir how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight
@AmericanAir You have a lot on your pLate Flight dealing with Cancelled Flightlations and weather tonite. Those are more important. I know you will respond.
@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on
@Southwestair thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?!
@VirginAmerica question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It's not giving me the option but we want a seat for him.
Awesome! RT @VirginAmerica: Watch nominated films at 35,000 feet. #MeetTheFleet #Oscars http://t.co/DnStITRzWy
@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF
@VirginAmerica brought it all the way across the country today I see http://t.co/TKaUyGcPmS
@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta
@USAirways I have been on hold with your Gold reservations line for OVER 3 HOURS now. Flight Cancelled Flightled. Trying to rebook.
@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic "sorry" email back
@JetBlue now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@AmericanAir 

Late Flight from phoenix, gave ticks away when arrived chicago, held bags hostage chicago, rented van drove to toledo. 5 hr drive.
@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
@AmericanAir Here you go https://t.co/oM1vIEg74a
@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
@SouthwestAir now accepting #Apple's Passbook app for boarding passes. App works on #iPhone &amp; #iPodTouch, not #iPad. http://t.co/XxSaomBdGS
@USAirways - Janet &amp; my DEN-PHL  flight Cancelled Flightled Saturday, USAIR rescheduled automatically &amp; notified us by email at no additional cost.
@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
@SouthwestAir I DMed you :)
@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
@USAirways now after an hour on the plane and knowing of a maint issue ahead of time they just announced another 30 mins. Y r we on plane?
@USAirways JUST LANDED flight 545. Any chance of making flight 5530 Phoenix to AUS
@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
@SouthwestAir cool the plane you said is ours that just left the terminal for a diff city? She a cold betch for "flying the friendly skies"
@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
@JetBlue I did see that! Working on picking up a trip or two as we type.
@USAirways @AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit?
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for the last 2 hours - no progress #pleasehelp #stranded #whenitsnowsitpours #tgcyaLate Flightr

@SouthwestAir how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site?
@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
@SouthwestAir when will you have flight from DAL to PVD?
@JetBlue will I be charged a fee to do so?
@USAirways still Effin waiting... Not weather delays, not engine trouble, but lack of crew?  Are you shitting me?
@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 1.5 hrs. What's up?
@SouthwestAir you have the worst service, you Cancelled Flightled all your flights FLL to PHL all @USAirways flights flew. Stuck in FL 3 days. #done
@USAirways will you hold #475 today for connecting passengers coming from delayed flights?
@USAirways hello! I never received a confirmation code for my flights (though they are confirmed--so says the automated reply). Any ideas?
@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on

@USAirways Round Two of being THE worst airline ever.
@AmericanAir i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to "heavy call volume."
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@AmericanAir But you called me - and hung up.
@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care.
@SouthwestAir sure,I'll send a message now!
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
@AmericanAir @kanne822 @SouthwestAir is better than AA.
@SouthwestAir de-icing is important!
@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided.
@AmericanAir sucks!! Teco teco #reclameaqui #TripAdvisor http://t.co/auGJsCmoLu
@AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn't get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that's not cool
@JetBlue my butt hurts.
@SouthwestAir change your hold music, going on hour 3 and i'm about to loose it
@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)

üò©üò©üò©‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BBHTlZgH2C‚Äù
@USAirways stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service!
@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to "listen to the intercom better".
@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
@USAirways can't even get on hold to wait to speak to someone-awesome
@USAirways you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir
@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj
@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
@SouthwestAir hot stewardess flipped me off
@AmericanAir can you use the aa credit platinum select world mastercard for Alaska flights?  Or just american?
@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
@USAirways My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines.
@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you "can't do anything" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7
@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody...
@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
@USAirways - why can't the gate agent on flight #759 provide an update? Seriously, this is ridiculous how long people have been waiting
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
@VirginAmerica Just bought tix for ATX - Dallas route - thanks for adding that! Love yr airline &amp; yr website is BEST transactional site EVER
@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
@SouthwestAir quick question: let's say I book a flight (I did so) and you then drop the price. Do I get the cheaper rate?
@SouthwestAir freezing in the plane
@united A3 Gold. So the international baggage limit apply when booked on 1 ticket,even for a domestic leg?  What if I travel with 2 friends?
@SouthwestAir still on the ground &gt;30mins after planned departure. And this is California. No weather here. Originally told 10 min delay.
@AmericanAir right on cue with the delaysüëå
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
Includes @KCIAirport ‚Äú@SouthwestAir: Inclement weather may impact scheduled service in. ReFlight Booking Problems options available: http://t.co/KeyrpFlHil‚Äù
@AmericanAir btw you guys should consider making a lounge at Austin Intl. airport! Very popuLate Flightd area! Will help the company for sureüëå
@VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@USAirways I do but the real ? Is why your staff can behave offensively. Flight 699. Please look into it. Message me if you want particulars
@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology
@SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ
@SouthwestAir @geekstiel Do you know when the last chance is?
@AmericanAir THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HELP!  :P You guys are the best.  #americanairlines #americanair
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/MB0hVfqB1t‚Äù-see what ihop started üòë
@USAirways please have your people hold flight 599 from Phoenix to San Jose.  We pulling up to the gate! Scheduled to depart at 5:40
@JetBlue we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today.
@USAirways the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins...
@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.
@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
@united why de-ice before taxing? Maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @Delta @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir
@JetBlue thank you #loyalmosaicmember
@united I'm not sure it will have "next time"...
@JetBlue, my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of @AmericanAir shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out
@JetBlue no m'good. Just get me home
@United I'd like to thank and recognize Terri P at Dulles for going out of her way to get me back on my Raleigh flight
@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
@USAirways on your website and on your boards at Logan it said it was on time, so we went through security and got to the gate (2)
@USAirways Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god.
@USAirways great operation you guys are running. More mechanical issues, and now taping piece of plane together LOL http://t.co/I5V9wfbtuE
@AmericanAir thanks for forcing me to check -in my carry - on luggage. That is exactly why I spent extra money on "travel size" toiletries
@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet
@SouthwestAir traditionally used sledge hammer - low $ taking share from driving | now scalpel approach through data science  #ANAmarketers
@USAirways So far....my phone wait time is longer than @ABCNetwork's #Oscars coverage. #WhatCustomerService
@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
@JetBlue No, it is one I'm trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International.
@SouthwestAir - Hi. My flight confirmation # is fwwe7f. We are currently stuck in Norfolk, Va. Trying to get to LGA in NYC. Ant updates? Thx
@USAirways good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport.  Need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule.
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir but they refused to unload our luggage so we're stuck in below freezing weather w/o our cold weather clothes.
@united is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet
@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
@SouthwestAir did you Cancelled Flight ALL flights into BNA today??? #needtogethome
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
@united Okay, thank you both.
@JetBlue Y U NO LET ME OUT AND MAKE FUN SIZE COOKIES #stuckonaplane #sos #babyfood
@SouthwestAir thank you : 8UXZJ2
Paid for early bird and sat in back
@united question. Are departure times based off eastern central time or the time zone your actually in?
@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say "we are experiencing high call volume" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?
@united good morning, any first class upgrades available for ua1619 Feb 25  rsw to ewr? I need 4 seats please
@JetBlue no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I'm sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine
@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?
@USAirways stuck in cae need reFlight Booking Problems for next flight possibly dm for more info
@USAirways Really hoping I don't get charged for this flight because they couldn't handle the influx of calls. Bummer.
@AmericanAir. All I get is an automated system that hangs up on me. I finally get a message that some will call me back in 2 hours.
@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
@JetBlue true. Maybe. Wish I had expedited security haha
@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy
@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
@united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it
@SouthwestAir awesome. thank you!
@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
@united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!!
@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
@AmericanAir it's always nice coming home but I wish you'd fly LAX-MAD and keep me away from Iberia üòú‚úàÔ∏è #GoingForGreat

@USAirways Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP
@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to "choose" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
@SouthwestAir 14 hours????  Sorry don't get it. Oh well. Screw the weekend in Az right?  Eat the hotel, no problem.
@AmericanAir @AmericanAir how do you expect to do that?
@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
@united now arrives LAX @ 8:03 am
@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled flights and asshole phone support. #worstairline
@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!
@united flt 912. Capt Herman is amazing! Came out before flight to play "ask the captain anything." Wonderful ambassador to the airline!!
@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help.
@AmericanAir My connecting flight to DFW was Cancelled Flightled and need to get to IND tomorrow. Any way I can get this sorted out? Been holding 1h08
@AmericanAir Yes, thanks for checking. Very cramped, but got on &amp; made it safely. Flying back tomorrow at 1pm. http://t.co/CSddCCMvbD
@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
@SouthwestAir  what is the status on flight#122 STL-AUS?
@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff
@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should‚Äôve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
@JetBlue? | RT @WMCActionNews5: New airline expected to make its way to MEM http://t.co/P6eef1zWzc
@USAirways @SDFAirport  I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved
@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
@usairways #usairways #unacceptable #holdtime REALLY?! http://t.co/UPp41AbxrQ
@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
@united why am i mot getting my refund?
@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
@USAirways will all flights out of DFW be Cancelled Flightled today?
@united thanks! Everything a-ok now.
@USAirways we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far
@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@SouthwestAir baggage claim has already changed 2x...most recent had 3 bags come out and then stop...claim team has no idea what's going on
@JetBlue Hi there, any rough idea of when January 2016 flights will be made available?
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@VirginAmerica Already checked in so the page expired :X
@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!
@SouthwestAir Is my friend lucky enough to see #DestinationDragons live on his birthday? He's been a fan for years @thirty_lives
@USAirways The automated message isn't helpful and it's impossible to speak with a human right now. Desperately need our luggage :(
@VirginAmerica thanks! Y'all have some of the best customer service left in the industry.
@SouthwestAir Already rebooked for tomorrow. Fingers crossed!
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/tEjrN09tfw‚Äù NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!

@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta
@SouthwestAir My boyfriend and I have LOVED @Imaginedragons since 2009 &amp; it would be so awesome to go to Vegas event. Any way you can help?
@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
@SouthwestAir I ‚ù§Ô∏è you! The only airline that understands us military families and our unpredictable changes. Pound it üëä
@SouthwestAir followed.
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
.@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now
@JetBlue whose performing at T5
@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
@USAirways -beg to differ. 4 things booked wrong and still not fixed. Get your act together! #USAirSucks
@AmericanAir so, what should he do next exactly?!
@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
@USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS
@JetBlue @courteroy LOLZ. "On Fleek"
@VirginAmerica I'm sure a lot of your 747 and 777 JFK-LHR flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind.
@SouthwestAir I am absolutely sick of 300s and no wifi!
@VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait.
@USAirways Are you guys awake? Need help with delayed flight to get protected on Late Flightr flight from PHL.
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.
@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
@USAirways been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options?
@VirginAmerica So excited for my first cross country flight LAX to MCO I've heard nothing but great things about Virgin America. #29DaysToGo
@SouthwestAir Any chance the flight I just took can count for #3? I mean, I signed up with SW wifi in the air! 2/2

@SouthwestAir thanks for the b day concert I watched them all (and noticed the fist bump/high five at the end of the "rock" version)
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@USAirways great job today from your team with a challenging weather delay on flight 1925 out of Charlotte. #travel #friendlyteam
@united still waiting for a response on whether or not you allow use of a rear facing car seat on an ERJ145.
@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.
@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call
@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
@USAirways I'm amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers.
@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.
@JetBlue Thanks for taking me back home today despite Pandora's best efforts to Cancelled Flight the flight. #jetblue #backhome #noplacelikehome
@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077
@USAirways My family, friends and colleagues will NEVER  fly USAir again. Bad weather happens. The good airlines seem to communicate better.
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@VirginAmerica Anytime, sugafly.
@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler

@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
@USAirways been on hold way to long!  Is this the best level of service you can provide? - one hour+ is too long!
@JetBlue @JayVig YES! Great real-time example. Thanks for being awesome, #JetBlue! #JVMChat
@USAirways why don't you hire people to deal with the call volume, this is absolute garbage #incompetent
@VirginAmerica I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. 
http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@SouthwestAir http://t.co/tTXRSyNLxr doesn't work on my flight. Just fyi.
@JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza
@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
@VirginAmerica @freddieawards Done and done! Best airline around, hands down!
@SouthwestAir done
@SouthwestAir up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might "know" but don't show it.
@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
@united I already did.
@AmericanAir thanks! a response is better than nothing at all {ahem, @USAirways}
@SouthwestAir flight 3899 HOU to MDW aboard a Boeing 73, boarded for an on-time 2PM departure. #WheelsUp #fb

@JetBlue lmfao.
@VirginAmerica it was amazing, and arrived an hour early. You're too good to me.
@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
@VirginAmerica Hi, I'm trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues
@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united
@AmericanAir When Flight Booking Problems an int'l flight online, do I have to provide a passport number when Flight Booking Problems or just when I arrive at airport?
@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)
@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit

@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
@SouthwestAir never mind, I moved my flight to tomorrow. Thanks for the help!
@SouthwestAir no thanks
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
@USAirways I have a MAJOR complaint that I want to address w/you about my hand luggage courtesy check-in. What's the best way to do this?
@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
@jetblue offered me a complimentary drink for switching seats. Stewardess asked for my age &amp; I said 30. We giggled. #goodgenes #ilookyoung
@SouthwestAir thanks to Ella-Mae at LAS counter for going above and beyond to help us get back to ABQ after our flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful
@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?
@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta
@SouthwestAir weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
@USAirways 5 hours on the phone waiting for a call back to find my luggage #shameonyou
@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?
@SouthwestAir - I get that weather delays are not in your hands, but is there nothing else you can offer for the massive inconvenience?
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@SouthwestAir Are we sure flights will not be Cancelled Flighted after 1200 I am trying to make plans in STL
@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
@USAirways No US Air ppl anywhere in PHL directed stranded pax. Kudos to the PHL employees getting off work at midnight. Only help we got.
@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
@AmericanAir Thanks to AA for the upgrade today and getting me on a new flight after my first one was Cancelled Flightled!
@JetBlue Crisis averted! Flight #69 from BOS to FLL is boarding. Let's hope the new pilots aren't Clarence Oveur and Roger Murdock. :-)
@USAirways half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming
@united How long can I expect the formal response to take?
@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
@SouthwestAir why was flight 4199 out of Boston tmrw @ 1230 Cancelled Flightled?
@USAirways might possibly be THE WORST airline ever! I think it's time to brush up on customer service! #sorude
@JetBlue Maybe I'll just go to Cleveland instead.
@United "Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."
@SouthwestAir I sent you my conf number yesterday.
@AmericanAir To think that I'm a "Priority Member"! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately.
@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
@united Thank you! Have a nice evening.
@SouthwestAir RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw.
@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
@united I'm aware, I fly a lot :) Just sad I had to change my shoes (boots), ha! #HappyFlight
@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update.
.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you
@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
@JetBlue I'll take 3 round trip tickets to the closest warmest place please! #negativedegrees #buffalo #snowwillnevermelt
@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won‚Äôt fix it.
@USAirways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen...
@JetBlue pilot: "Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane." Thanks guy
@SouthwestAir  Tried to DM you, it won't let me as it says you are not following me.
@VirginAmerica Thank you for the follow
@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
@SouthwestAir . I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
@JetBlue Just sent it
@SouthwestAir thx - i managed to figure it out by trying diff confirmation #s as i booked. just annoying it's not readily available!
@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
@SouthwestAir New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/iQnVyFPg4P
@SouthwestAir We need help changing a name on a company reservation....We tried calling customer relations but there is a busy signal.
@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.
@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
@SouthwestAir @Matt_e_Boss how long did you have to hold? We waited 35 minutes and gave up
@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure
@USAirways I‚Äôd suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
@USAirways @AmericanAir ok the app doesn't seem to be working. just use the mobile site... http://t.co/4kLfywwMq1
@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
@SouthwestAir Thank you. Great tool
@AmericanAir working over time tonight?  Got delayed 2 days .. In SJU .. Could be worse :)
@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
@united while busy on his cell phone ???
@united you hung up on me again.
@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
@VirginAmerica, you're doing a great job adding little luxuries/aesthetics that improve the air travel experience. Thank you. Keep it up!
@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
@SouthwestAir - wow! 100 minutes on hold, so far. Now phone is dying...
@JetBlue Hello! Can you tell me if you currently fly to Hawaii? Thanks!
@AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still "Now Boarding"...
@jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me
@USAirways Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$?
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vOUUFRN4jS‚Äù YASSS JetBlue ! Tell them !
@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - @TheVDT http://t.co/h6cE3mWCqj
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
@JetBlue If this is customer service, then please call me.
@AmericanAir that's if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer
@AmericanAir flights out of Dallas on Tuesday are not going to be Cancelled Flightled correct?
@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
@united Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend?
@united please see dm!!
@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
@USAirways yes I did thank you! They did a great job turning the flight in jan !
@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
@JetBlue I would go anywhere JetBlue goes.
@SouthwestAir got it.  Next time I will know about paying extra to make the A Line.
@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
@USAirways will do. Hoping for a voucher for a future flight #Optimistic
@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.
Bruh...real tweet from @JetBlue "Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dqny4aKTg9"
@AmericanAir Eventually the call got through. Not sure what changed. Thank you a lot though!
@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :(
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
@JetBlue U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn't extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. http://t.co/xZY7pHKFGR
@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a "no show"
@AmericanAir we have 8 ppl so we need 2 know how many seats are on the next flight. Plz put us on standby for 4 people on the next flight?
@AmericanAir SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort..
@USAirways making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL
@AmericanAir Is it possible to change the FF number on a passenger on a Flight Booking Problems, it won't let me change it?
@United, #deaffriendly? Getting there. Read your review on http://t.co/2Brt0aTHaU: http://t.co/WzNp5q1M0H
@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?
@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
@AmericanAir my flight out of TYR tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. How long until a rebook?
@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????
@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
@SouthwestAir - been on hold forever. My first flight was Cancelled Flightled but my 2nd flight is still on time - HELP!
@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
@AmericanAir The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed "help"
@united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed?
@AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
@united Based on suggestions from other passengers I have a rental car on standby for 11:30.  One way or another will be leaving then.
@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
@AmericanAir my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz?
.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
@SouthwestAir Love Southwest. You guys have been good to me! http://t.co/X4tDY84dBH
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Daily Journal http://t.co/9bzqZQx8DC
@JetBlue yes Party is Over üòÇ
@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping out! Class act, all the way... see you in the air!
@JetBlue thanks...
@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.
#flyunited
@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
@AmericanAir: my brother's flight into DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday. Are you flying from ONT to DFW today?
@SouthwestAir I urgently need two receipts sent but CS is closed. Can you help?
@JetBlue no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!!
@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
@AmericanAir Thank you
@USAirways through, can you confirm that I haven't been charged?
@united crashed trying to check in.
@SouthwestAir I just wanna say you're incredible for sending people to see their idols. Sooooo kind and amazingüíñ #DestinationDragons
@USAirways but my bag is still missing
@SouthwestAir took delivery of N8661A, a new Boeing 737-8H4 yesterday. http://t.co/5z9STyUQJ3 #DFW #DAL #airlines
@SouthwestAir Can I get any help with Cancelled Flighting my flight reservation?
@SouthwestAir Being old I will miss my connection and can sleep at OAK or get a hotel on my own dime rubs me the wrong way. I wasn‚Äôt Late Flight.
@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@JetBlue follow for DM please
@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response, we got it resolved at the counter.
@united happens every time in and out of Newark.
@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
@AmericanAir just downloaded the app for iPhone.  Notice drink coupon but nothing is displayed?  Getting ready to fly...
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 hours. Need to re-book a flight, please help.
@united that's not an apology. Say it.
@JetBlue @hanneslohmann cool
@SouthwestAir my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn't get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS!
@USAirways @BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons #DestinationDragons Scavenger Hunt rules: http://t.co/vHgkiTzSaw
@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
Yall tried it. "@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/62GoDFaKNB‚Äù
@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
@JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice
@VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
@united I'm in another country - please Cancelled Flight my reservation. I've booked through Swiss air
@JetBlue do you sell open tickets? I have a sick relative and may have to travel at a moments notice. Sad but true.
@AmericanAir You didn't call, did you. Try it, and then you'll understand.  It's not possible to reach an agent,I don't know what else to do
@JetBlue sale please soon?? I need a tan
@USAirways i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week.
@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the champagne  AA153 ORD-NRT to celebrate my #TokyoMarathon2015 finish! http://t.co/Ij4xL01tKX
@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...
@SouthwestAir thank you!!
@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
@JetBlue Thanks for the $100 credit because of the 4hr delay. I can tell customer service means a lot to YOU #Thankful
@JetBlue right now completely pissed off
@AmericanAir Just learned my flight is Cancelled Flightled.can't get through by phone and don't see any option for assistance online. Any suggestions?
@AmericanAir I FOUND MY FOOTAGE!! :D I am so so happy.
@USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again.
@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags
‚Äú@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP‚Äù THANK YOU!  United Cares!
@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth
@SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
@USAirways hundreds of people in line and less than half the desks being manned at CLT. Help?
.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
@SouthwestAir I have sent the DM, should I continue to wait on hold with a rep, or will you be servicing me here?
@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
@USAirways can you DM me please?
@AmericanAir stop sending me back to "customer relations "I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!
@VirginAmerica Love the team running Gate E9 at LAS tonight. Waited for a delayed flight, and they kept things entertaining
@AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA
@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@United Bringing your "A" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY
@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
@USAirways What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow
@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?
@USAirways I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP?
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman
@SouthwestAir any chance of adding LAX-&gt;JFK direct any time in the future?
@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
@JetBlue Using JetBlue air miles?
@AmericanAir its now 17 days since I contacted customer relations... #surf #fail #BaggageDrama http://t.co/CS1673hrqQ
@VirginAmerica Flight Booking Problems flight to uphold my status match.  Do taxes on ticket count as earned status points?  #statusmatch #virginamerica
@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimiüò≠ why dont you guys go to maimi???
@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
@SouthwestAir Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn't showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile...
@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
@JetBlue Why doesn't your "Best Fare Finder" work?
@JetBlue is amazing. Had a short delay. They gave me $150 credit! It was literally pretty much my fault I missed the flight.
@VirginAmerica Having an issue finding a missing item on a plane. Can you help me find which airport my plane headed to next?
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
@AmericanAir you're almost as bad as @united
@JetBlue 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn't work agian!!and that's the main reason I fly jetblue üòîüòìüò§
@USAirways thanks for the seat that doesn't recline. I'm shocked I'm not being asked to serve everyone drinks on the plane.  #DoBetter
@SouthwestAir what number can we use to all from outside the US? Thx
@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles
@USAirways to my legal last name. So it's not technically a name change,
I just used the wrong name
@JetBlue she was a phone agent, pls do! Peggy was pleasant, informative and delivered. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
@USAirways @AmericanAir you make Spirit look like the gem of air travel. You haven't handle this winter storm very well...
@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
@USAirways Y'all need to get it together
@united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?
@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I DO like your airlines, congrats! : )
@JetBlue thanks for the info... Figured that was the case. Hopefully my new hashtag will change that ;) #ABCLetJetBlueStreamFeed
@SouthwestAir What do you call that??!!
@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(
@SouthwestAir "Airport snow removal method #22.."
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/7poFSXOjSY
@USAirways worst experience ever!!!!
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@JetBlue well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
@AmericanAir Flight 2954, Dallas to Grand Junction #AmazingFlightCrew
@SouthwestAir why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH
@JetBlue is it true there's a new A320 livery and a new website...?!
@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
@JetBlue honestly I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I‚Äôll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/
@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
@JetBlue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
@USAirways Still waiting for another crew member. #cabinfever
@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
@JetBlue Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@SouthwestAir No worries at all!!! I would rather be safe on the ground than take any chances. Yes! Tomorrow AM if BNA reopens ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
@SouthwestAir again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I'm getting different reports?
@USAirways Is your refund system down?
@JetBlue Sent.
@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
@united Thanks! Just DMed HN.
@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
@SouthwestAir are you hiring for flight attendants right now
@SouthwestAir my son is flying South West from NOLA-Orlando, hope to enter for him to win this contest #DestinationDragons
@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
@JetBlue alittle more money to book our flights... we're 1/2 way there :)
@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
@united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport
@USAirways thank you.
@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
@united welcome to our world, that's a snow world today. @GooseBayAirport Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. http://t.co/4kI6Xr67nk
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable

@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!

@AmericanAir is that the "record locator"?
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
@united ‚Ç¨202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?
@AmericanAir since we are leaving tomorrow to miami can you do one thing right and deliver the bags to the airport?
@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice

@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you

@AmericanAir two delayed flights today that weren't weather reLate Flightd. Keep up the good work!
@united please don't take my membership away :(
@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not
@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care

@USAirways you guys suck at JFK tonight -- oh this MORNING!!!
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir Thanks :-) Good to be back safely. See you again soon!
@JetBlue you know it!!
@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have "planned better."
.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
@AmericanAir If you care, could you have someone call me to explain what is going on.
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@JetBlue  would love to go to Hawaii to visit pearl harbor.

@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!
@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call "customer service" in the future now.
@JetBlue My #FlyingItForward affects just one small family of four, but it would make a huge difference in their life.
@JetBlue just touched down in #NewOrleans for the annual @HeinekenUSACorp national distributor conference! #livethelegend
@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
@AmericanAir Can't get thru by phone to use a credit that's about to expire! #frustrated #aa.com
@united how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don't see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!!
@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?
@VirginAmerica - Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2
@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?
@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?
@JetBlue  hmmm it says im following you. We just got de-iced, but still haning around for the runway to clear..
@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks
@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@SouthwestAir thank you!
@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
@AmericanAir I have never on all my trips on any airline ever nat'l or int'l ever experienced anything like this!
.@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
@USAirways just hit 4hrs.  what is typical wait time right now? should i drive 2h30m to the airport service desk?
@USAirways thanks for nothing
@SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove
@united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?
@SouthwestAir   Are flights going into Dallas this morning?   Thanks
@USAirways AA Gate Supervisor emplid 600117 allowed flight AA67 to leave JFK to SJ on 20feb15 w/o 8 customers that made final boarding call.
@AmericanAir Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail
@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
@VirginAmerica achieves a second year of profitability despite revenue pressure ... - @CAPA_Aviation http://t.co/zSuZTNAIJq

@JetBlue insane the craziness I've seen with Jet Blue today at Newark Delayed 3 hours and now we are waiting for a Pilot!! #jetblue
@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens....
@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
@SouthwestAir It was never really "lost" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!
@JetBlue We already won the tickets but she's totally on a beach right now. #flightlanding #sunscreen #feelsgood http://t.co/5PvG2hJXKp
@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
@JetBlue thanks for your help! #jetbluesofly
@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.üò°
@united "federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag"...yet you lose our bag and that's okay
@USAirways Seriously. You can't tweet and let people know that you've got customers that have been on hold for 5 HOURS??!!
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@JetBlue I've been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
@USAirways going to miss my connection because my flight home has been delayed and now no gate agent to get us off the plane-so frustrated
@JetBlue are @AskAmex Amex Plat holders provided access or a credit in the Airspace Lounge in JKF?

@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
@USAirways  and now I'm going to miss my G'ma's Memorial because I didn't #FlyDelta.
.@USAirways Have you just given up?
@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as "on time" #updateyourwebsite #489
@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. üòî
@virginamerica how's a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky
@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
@JetBlue check DM please :)
@JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on
@AmericanAir yes I do I am traveling to Marsh Harbor
@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èüôèüôèüôè
@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
@JetBlue when are you guys flying it froward in the Bahamas.
@SouthwestAir aren't you based in Chicago? Why are you doing a hunt in LA and not your home city????!! Please bring one home
@JetBlue here you go... Your napkins pretty much say it all! http://t.co/OxY1Jnpjm3
@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
@VirginAmerica had to change to another airline to get to DC today ... Why is @united able to land in DC but not you? Cost me $800 ...ugh
@JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston
@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
@USAirways can't seem to find the pilots for our 6pm flight, never seen anything like it before #drunkpilots http://t.co/Zira2z3UDc
@SouthwestAir truly the best in #customerservice.  If something goes wrong, no matter how big or small the issue was, they fix it. Thank you
@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw
@SouthwestAir humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?
@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
@USAirways the plane i am on is having mechanical issues. Why cant i get off and get on a new flight? Now i have missed my connecting flight
We didn't need this. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cpZB285o71
@AmericanAir thanks to AA / DART for getting me home in time for work this morning DEN-DFW... didn't have to waste a vaca day @dartmedia
@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
‚Äú@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH‚Äù always blame the customer
@SouthwestAir flight to San Diego is delayed per usual.. take me home!
@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.
@VirginAmerica If you'd love to see more girls be inspired to become pilots, RT our free WOAW event March 2-8 at ABQ. http://t.co/rfXlV1kGDh
@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx.
@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is
@AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
@VirginAmerica always!!! Xoxo
@JetBlue flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I'm all for erring on the side of safety but it's an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!!
@AmericanAir 
Thank you for responding...My laptop is in my bag and I need it for work. I am worried. The file code is UTEVGW.
@SouthwestAir you have open seats on flight 4001 pvd to MCO @ 1215pm today?
@AmericanAir my flight to San Angelo via Dallas from Orlando Cancelled Flighted help! On hold and disconnect
@SouthwestAir I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?

@AmericanAir thanks so much!
@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions.
@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage
@USAirways I better get a free flight
@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
@JetBlue all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue
@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
@usairways I have been on hold for over 3 hours.  Please help! http://t.co/tyXAZtMQ1U
Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways

@JetBlue thanks for your reply. It was flight 1572.
@USAirways @PHLAirport we don't control your stupidity in not having room to have a plane come in. You better not mess with us now.
@united @staralliance Very nice at LHR, congrats, but I'm sticking with AA/#BA. @AmericanAir @British_Airways
@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle.
@united 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please
@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!
@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
@USAirways  Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours
@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
@SouthwestAir Loved one's flight ATL to IND Cancelled Flightled due to "ice in Indy". Sitting here in Indy, it is bone dry. Tomorrow 4-6" of snow.

@JetBlue perfect! Probably need some coffee to stay awake during the night ;)
@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore.
@united no u don't
@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir for our delays !!! I'm out of more money because of you

@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Love SW foreverüòÉüíïüòç‚§¥‚§¥
@JetBlue is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby?
@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
@AmericanAir why are there only 2 agents at domestic check in at MIA?! WTF? Huge lines and many people with Cancelled Flightled flights.
@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
@SouthwestAir and thx for not responding
@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5
@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft
Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
@AmericanAir make that 7hours now
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight out of BNA today. Been on hold for an hour. üò† #frustrated!
@SouthwestAir already booked my tickets for August 20th-30th!  Can't wait for my vacation!
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flightled and was trying to reschedule but 800 number just says to call back
@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
@AmericanAir checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas.  Baggage was only checked to ORD.
@USAirways while I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶ 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat.

@AmericanAir can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights?
@USAirways please keep Emily at you gso airport ticketing on staff she is amazing

@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!
@USAirways thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.

@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
@SouthwestAir I owe you an apology. My tweet was out of frustration, not constructive criticism. I'm a SW fan &amp; LOVE your service!
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@JetBlue 
Apparently not.

@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?

@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!

@USAirways that is certainly not the impression she's under.
@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your "team" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting.
@JetBlue #Bluemanity @AirlineAdviser loves this. Have a great time flying this

@SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading!
@AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it‚Äôs the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather.
@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD
@USAirways @ClaudOakeshott how about a link that works pls Nothing but complete frustration w usair last 12 hrs
@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.

@SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
STOP @JetBlue
@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase.
@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!
@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number.
@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams

@AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min
@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
@AmericanAir does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible
@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
@USAirways flight 837 passengers stuck on plane in Philly. Where is the gangway?  We can't hear the pilot
@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it.
@JetBlue awesome, thanks!
@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding.
@JetBlue How is travel bank credit issued by your company fraud - I acquired credit from family friend Charles Kravitz - see his account
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@JetBlue two rows
@SouthwestAir how you gonna Cancelled Flight my flight but run flights at the exact same time? Cmon fam
@JetBlue thanks

@JetBlue Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help
@AmericanAir No! We departed 24 hours Late Flightr, with a crazy crew. One of the lady simply freaked out and got away from job before departure.
@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
@AmericanAir you bet make this screw up right (for once). Things I need in bag for my job and you have "grounded" me today #painandsuffering

@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?
@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!
@SouthwestAir well, it was fun while it lasted. Not happy about the change to redeeming reward points. Won't be loyal anymore.
@SouthwestAir Flight 4968 (N8325D) departs @MCO enroute to @NO_Airport http://t.co/fd4SnvKIeM

@USAirways This flight was for my brother. He has been rebooked and I was able to give my info over the phone to get him a pass to the Club.
@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today

@JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting.
@JetBlue did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24

@SouthwestAir been on hold for over an hour.....not cool, you guys.
@united Thank you for the new Club at O'Hare. Very comfortable. You made the difficult weather days proficient and enjoyable.
@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever

@SouthwestAir  why are you the only airlines to Cancelled Flight all flights into BNA? Been stranded in philly for 2 days. Hoping to get out in the AM
@AmericanAir @dfwairport listening to all the flights taking off over my house and kicking myself for Flight Booking Problems an AM flight tomorrow. Iceday?
@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made
@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren‚Äôt going to improve my poor airport experiences.
@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
@usairways I've called for 3 days and can't get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn't result in you hanging up on me?
@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink üòï
@USAirways Will do. I appreciate the response.
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@SouthwestAir I just received your birthday card.  It was amazing and made me smile with joy.  Nice videos.  Thanks.
@SouthwestAir lets chat about flights to and from BWI and the Carolina area... Can a girl get break? I've had to resort to USAir üòñ 2 a day?!
@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
@USAirways following you now
@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft.
@USAirways I've been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that's after being hung up on the first time.
@SouthwestAir bos to msp, msp to aus, aus to bos. Site doesn't seem to display fields for the middle trip when I add the 3rd.
@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
@united still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD
@AmericanAir ...2/2 doesn't help me.
@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?
@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
@USAirways can you please have your employee that has been called 5 times by the flight crew finish maintenance on US 734 so we can depart!
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@AmericanAir thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early
@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE üò§#ANGRY
@SouthwestAir I have been in contact and know there are changes but it's a destination you should really evaluate! Thanks
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol.
@USAirways to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile
@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.
@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's "not worth it" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS
@united stellar customer service. You have earned my business by your attention to detail.
@JetBlue @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation.
@JetBlue awe you guys are great can't wait to travel with you again soon!!!
@AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
@AmericanAir why thank you!! Yayayay!!
@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
@VirginAmerica moved my seat with no notice. "Better seat" is cabin select not behind the row I selectedüëé #DISAPPOINTED
@USAirways are there such things as non-delayed flights or na? Get your shit together and get me out of here
@VirginAmerica Do you provide complimentary upgrades to first class, if there are available seats?
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
@JetBlue no one yet but some, fl 8162
@united thank you.
It's my daughters 13th bd party w/proj. weather cond, it doesn't look promising.
Please assist with earlier flts to Cmh?
‚Äú@JetBlue: @KyleComer_ JetBlue reLate Flightd this time? ;)‚Äù no... But why won't school be Cancelled Flighted? it's very cold out
@JetBlue I put it my "to" and "from" airports, click update and it tells me to put in my "to" and "from" airports.
@USAirways this has been my WORST flying experience with you guys, you need to do better
@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit.
@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
@AmericanAir my flight 129 to dallas and 259 to SFO has been Cancelled Flighted and they can't get me on anything else until tomorrow. You won't put
@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
@JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
@SouthwestAir  no such thing as a free flight. Gonna be spending $100 on board rental bc #swa couldn't get my baggage to greenville w me.
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
@USAirways btw, not upset at usaiways, promise.
@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!
@AmericanAir are you expecting flights out of DFW to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow AM and afternoon?
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@SouthwestAir Looks like brooding skies out of ONT this evening. http://t.co/X9BLwgWA68
@JetBlue great trip today!  Thanks to the crew flying us home, they were fantastic! http://t.co/sk6W9XQaQB
@USAirways truly been the worst experience this weekend. Delayed, rerouted 3x, now not boarding A 715 flight and says flight is "on time"
@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?
@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks
@USAirways I want to love you! 43 minutes on hold! Help me understand why I switched loyalty programs. http://t.co/cHGy5yrVka
@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
@SouthwestAir I'm scheduled to come back tomorrow, finally but I don't know SWA hasn't flown out of @Fly_Nashville yet but @Delta has
@USAirways Feeling helpless at Tanpa airport. How can I talk to someone. Flight delayed 4 times. Need help. Missed connections will be prob
@SouthwestAir understand weather is an issue but on time Cancelled Flighted reinstated Cancelled Flighted with hardly any updates and doing nothing for me= :(

@JetBlue Love you guysüòçüòçüòç http://t.co/3X9NRUOvtS
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
@SouthwestAir Thanks a ton!
@VirginAmerica shares up on 4Q results - @iol http://t.co/XZ6qeG3nef
@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
@JetBlue flight 705. EWR to FLL
@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!
@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
@SouthwestAir yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again.
@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
@JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name
@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed
@USAirways Darn it, first in line for no upgrade! Wish I understood the policy. :) http://t.co/xGPaAyFDwt
@SouthwestAir Just watched crew on flight 380 help elderly lady off plane...#firstclass
@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
@JetBlue question, flying for the 1st time with my 16mont old son...do I need to bring anything for him? Birth certificate/S.S. card etc?
@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
@SouthwestAir No I have not.
@AmericanAir not anymore.
@united is pri boarding for "Active Military" or only "In Uniform?" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel
@united [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i'm all set. :-)
@USAirways undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail
@VirginAmerica gave a credit for my Late Flight flight yesterday. Great service !!!! That's a Wow moment! Unexpected gesture!
@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
@AmericanAir ticks me off.
@JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??
@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!
@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
@jetblue always #mosaicmecrazy #sunrise #bestairline #nofilterneeded &amp; how can you not love #FlyFi‚Ä¶ http://t.co/NY6CS7jRuV
@USAirways you need to figure your scheduling out! #worstflightexperienceever #getmehome
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@AmericanAir Love the new planes for the JFK-LAX run.  Maybe one day I will be on one where the amenities all function.  #NoCharge #Ever
RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/WEZUMDimYF
@SouthwestAir now flight is book and I have to fly standby if they will allow me to check in before the flight takes off
@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
@USAirways   Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly.
@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
@AmericanAir It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ?
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/4LlWi5oxvO‚Äù lmfaooooo hook me up with a flight!
@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
@SouthwestAir Amazing customer service as well. Will definitely fly with you guys again if my instrument is involved. #10/10
@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@AmericanAir how can I get travel question answered quickly... Online and calling not helping with this busy day
@JetBlue No changes made. My son's pass printed on same conf #. Just mine not print after I expressed disapptment w/ JetBlue
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@USAirways we've been waiting at the gate for 2 hrs, why are we now waiting to stow the luggage?
@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!
@USAirways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen?
@SouthwestAir do you have any tickets to the Atlanta show? I would love to go with my sister ‚ô•Ô∏èüôè
@SouthwestAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
@SouthwestAir always when I fly SW. #loyalRRmember
@JetBlue Haha you're doing everything right! Don't change a thing! Slash this Twitter engagement just makes you even cooler! #bestairline
@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
@JetBlue so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ...
@USAirways is the worst. Why on earth would @AmericanAir merge with them? I won't be flying either of them any time soon.
@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you
@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
@AmericanAir Kudos to the captain and crew for handling fustrated people while dealing with the preventable issues and shortcomings by maint
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
@USAirways one question. Can I book one way tickets with award travel/points
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ‚ù§‚ù§
@united Pick
@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
@AmericanAir United needs our ticket number since you rebooked us and you gave the incorrect ticket number now we can't check in #help
@SouthwestAir really shouldn't offer sweeps if your link isn't going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN
@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?
@USAirways horrible cust service exp at DIA today. Wife waited 3 hrs on the plane b/f flight 695 was Cancelled Flightled. Still waiting for bags.
@USAirways @AmericanAir how do I get thru on hold over 3 hours ?
@JetBlue will I be compensated for delays or Cancelled Flightlation?
@AmericanAir now you're sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain
.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
@USAirways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
@JetBlue Statement on #Lufthansa Incentive Offer - Digital Journal http://t.co/GqP69g9ZGW
@JetBlue what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424
@USAirways when your routing system goes down which grounds all your long haul flights you should think about a #failover plan
@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
@JetBlue will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations
@USAirways @AuroraBIZ check your bag, @PHLAirport bag handlers broke into my suitcase and stole my camera, bag was returned in a trash bag
@JetBlue Not really. I have a flight to catch at 1 pm in Vegas. I'm praying I don't miss the flight!
@USAirways delays to the max
@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
@VirginAmerica any plans to start flying direct from DAL to LAS?
@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
@united Classic
@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?
@united no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here.
@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life

@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?
@VirginAmerica Thanks!
@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."

@united yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question.
@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
@JetBlue received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers.
@AmericanAir - cruel &amp; unusual to Cancelled Flight flight w/o notice &amp; make someone stay on hold for 30min &amp; listen to the same ad in a loop
@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
@USAirways Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier, I am now Late Flightr!
@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in

@united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting.
@USAirways you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human.
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
@AmericanAir is flight 1318 Cancelled Flighted or not? No word from the ground staff.
@SouthwestAir will do - if you follow back I can DM that info
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine 
great news.
@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA
@JetBlue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.
@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh
@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
@JetBlue shout out to the crew on flight 89 headed back to the big apple, they kept my glass half full the whole flight! #jetbluejfk
@USAirways flight to Des Moines Cancelled Flightled. Unacceptable to be booked on flight on Tuesday because of work commitments. 2hrs on hold
@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night
@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/we7Pf5Ll1Y‚Äù lol!!!!!

@VirginAmerica For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would &lt;3 a bday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@SouthwestAir took our carryon bag with essential attire for a life changing interview tomorrow &amp; it's not here; can we expect compensation?
@SouthwestAir will you please start offering services out of @triflight and @AshevilleAir to other airports.. Have to drive 3-4 hrs to use u

@USAirways #695 might have been Cancelled Flighted? mechanical issue. 6 hours Late Flightr 100 people still waiting and Zero information. Please send help.
@JetBlue when can we start Flight Booking Problems flights for November?

@united @CheerTymeDad Gee that's like almost caring about ppl more than $$.  Think I'm more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed.

@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed.
@SouthwestAir my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.üò≠
@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now
@SouthwestAir need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired.
@SouthwestAir Conf #8Q6MFD Finally got through &amp; told the flight was completely booked.  That would have been better info than advise 2 call
@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!
@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
@JetBlue ive tried on my phone and laptop :(
@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??
@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv
@SouthwestAir when's the next deal going to happen a poor college student is trying to fly to Orlando instead of drive in August! Lol
@AmericanAir I'd love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has.  #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf http://t.co/9Gx5mMmubb
@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst
@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService
@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
@SouthwestAir FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said "well i was Late Flight"
@SouthwestAir @TifffyHuang I met my twitter friend waiting outside the Troubadour #DestinationDragons http://t.co/lf69waf5ad
@united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi
@JetBlue "Goodwill" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136
@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
‚Äú@USAirways: @TMadCLE We don't like to hear this. We're sorry that it's taking so long to get through.‚Äù Stop sending generic responses
@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
@JetBlue ripped my suitcase. I then was yelled at with attitude from Geraldine, your employee at the baggage center.Worst airline= #jetblue
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@USAirways I finally spoke to a person. Despite the mind boggling wait time, the rep was very pleasant and very helpful. Kudos to her.
@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
@united on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites
@AmericanAir please can you tell me why DFW has a weather advisory and RDU does not? the entire state of NC has shut down from ice &amp; snow!
@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now
@AmericanAir Delaney and Shawn at DFW showed exceptional customer service today. Will happily choose AA whenever possible now! Thank you!
@USAirways now in a black hole of your phone system
@JetBlue it seems I never received an ID, just a password.
@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes.
@JetBlue @MrJustyn I heard companies were studying popular lingo for advertising but this is just depressing and embarrassing.
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@JetBlue ready to go to Disneyworld!  For the @runDisney #PrincessHalf http://t.co/sTQY9V8256
@JetBlue @CinziannaP thank you! I like the quick response on Twitter!
@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
@SouthwestAir doesn't want to deal with me, but the world might want to know how they are treating their customers: http://t.co/sKKewqhssG
@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
@USAirways can I get an update on flight 680 to DCA?
@JetBlue understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight?
@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week
@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
@USAirways Don't tell me that. Tell me what I can actually DO to reach someone. I don't mind being put on hold but it won't even do THAT.
@SouthwestAir can you please make sense of the companion promo? How to we set it up?
@USAirways if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again?
@USAirways yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18
@VirginAmerica is todays flight from Palm Springs, Ca to JFK in NY Cancelled Flightled?
@USAirways your team member at DCA- Tamara R. is her name was awesome. You should have more employees like her!
‚Äú@JetBlue: @Ruth_Slobodin Why not? We'd sure love to see you, Ruth! #JustDoIt #YouKnowYouWantTo ;)‚Äù you know me too well üíò
@USAirways Ok Thanks
@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
@AmericanAir  thanks hoping that by wed I can get back to DFW
@USAirways chose you for a flight with very time sensitive arrival And you drop the ball. What gives? CLT #667 good way to lose my business
@SouthwestAir Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID.
@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!
I hate you all. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/uTdfqF5WPA
@SouthwestAir Please start charging for carryon luggage. #CarryOnBagsSlowEverybodyDown
@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@SouthwestAir do we get to pick which @Imaginedragons show? #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir you delayed me for 15 hours in Chicago and still managed to lose my bag! Really not happy
@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!
@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
@united any updates with the DOT looking at the united fares from London to the US from last week?
@AmericanAir my flight number is 3M 50
@AmericanAir Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work I go. #WeeklyCommuteOnAA http://t.co/JQHg4jTm4w

@USAirways Uh yeah. Flight boarded &amp; now 1 hr Late Flightr we still sit. Update on 4435 to DCA?
@JetBlue here we go again, 2nd round trip to CA in a week #TrueBlue
@JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was "There is nothing we can do" idk if that's what you mean
@JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight
@AmericanAir flights have been on time Late Flightly though!
@USAirways delayed depart bc ur flight attendant wasn't there. Then after landing took 3 hrs to get a gate. Now it's another he and NO bags
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/5KshTUe6Q0‚Äù üòÇ
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè
@SouthwestAir thanks for the ride to Chicago. #kmdw #b738 http://t.co/6cpYPGFnD6
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
Well lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue
@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues
@united I will not be flying you again
@AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans üëÄ
@USAirways Thank you so much its been a very stressful day
@USAirways it's vegas baby who doesn't have a good time in vegas lol
@USAirways I have been calling for 3 days!
@SouthwestAir neveind, it's been found and on its way. Thanks for making the process so painless
@SouthwestAir you are failing! Diverted, stuck and no communication! Make a decision and let us go!!!! üòûüò° flight #4229
@VirginAmerica I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness
@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface
@USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.
@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
@USAirways Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
@USAirways not even on your dime and free tickets.  #worsttraveldayever
@JetBlue For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look "normal" ????
@united Definitely will!
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@united thanks.  Not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/WNdcEO5QlK
@united Yes. Luckily I was there.
@americanair Can someone contact me about my awful experience with american airlines this weekend
@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
@USAirways link didn't work via Mobil.
@JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting.
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@united flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage???
@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
@united did I win :)
@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR
@AmericanAir just sad that even after spending so much on tickets all I wanted was for my wife to still go with her sister and no help
@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot
@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
@AmericanAir &amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason
@JetBlue yeah that's all been done. Define "incidentals"? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste?
@JetBlue I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me.
@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.
@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)
@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@SouthwestAir Thanks so much. Appreciate your kindness in adjusting our reservation. Even during snowstorms, I still prefer Southwest. üëç
@united JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home

@SouthwestAir All Flights lead to VEGAS BABY!
@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
@SouthwestAir #JamesAsworth has the worst corporate account manager #22 Brent. I will now take my 70plus flights to @Delta thank you
@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we'll be sure to fill out your survey!!
@united still waiting
@SouthwestAir I know where that is! Alas I live far, far away now. #Books
@Jetblue first airline to use #applepay in flight #airlines
@JetBlue the you above all commercials? Like the legroom one
@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
@JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time..
@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?
@timbennettg3 @USAirways Cancelled Flightled 4532 sch departure 8:38 am, wasn't snowing yet and other flights were still leaving #Fail
@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
@SouthwestAir Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today...
@JetBlue They just came out. Thanks for the follow-up. That's why you're the best!
@JetBlue flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies
@USAirways now over 2 hrs. Can't wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways http://t.co/BuwjTVUWKM
@JetBlue thanks. I appreciate your prompt response.
@JetBlue I'd fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue
@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.
@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
@SouthwestAir the 5:50 is sold out too?
@united Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He's competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@AmericanAir we got to 15 minutes AFTER takeoff time before anyone wandered over to address the line of people.
@USAirways My hubby has a 5hr layover in DFW fm the cxl'd flt. Pls help get him home sooner if you can! Any room on S/by 2 BWI or PHL today?
@united thx for update
@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.

@SouthwestAir Flight 3111 (N614SW) departs @MCO enroute to Indianapolis International Airport http://t.co/qefKFWZo7d
@SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting
@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.
@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need.
@USAirways I'm referring to email like this.  Just tell people when they GET the upgrade. Otherwise, we know already. http://t.co/N8UvCLMADA
@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0

@united can you assign seats
@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
@united lol too little too Late Flight
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
@USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone!
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
@SouthwestAir Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I've been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human
@JetBlue Lekvhg want to see what the cost would be to change to the 430 flight
@JetBlue I can't find a good photo of it... You got one? #goodnight
@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
@USAirways great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights
@VirginAmerica Your chat support is not working on your site: http://t.co/vhp2GtDWPk
@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
@USAirways Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I've Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you.
@USAirways horrible customer service, flying from Miami to Philadelphia, sent to Charlotte, now can't get out of Charlotte!
@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
@united Give Cyndi &amp; Troy each a gold star.

@JetBlue I cheated on you, and I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. @SouthwestAir has given my wife and I the worst start to a honeymoon ever
@united give her the recognition she deserves!
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
@USAirways sure knows how to pamper customers they strand abroad. #badcustomerservice #fend4yourself #youareonyourown http://t.co/Pw1eudlcZg

@SouthwestAir I tried again with your in-flight wifi #fail
@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
@JetBlue good luck. Thanks.
@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation.
@USAirways thanks for making me check my bag when the space was empty and to the flight attendant for the dirty look http://t.co/9rx5HOmM25
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@VirginAmerica you suck!
@AmericanAir thanks for the recommendation. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago.
@SouthwestAir went to front restroom on plane, on sink sign that said no water, use hand sanitizer. First time I've ever seen that. GROSS!
@JetBlue hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR.
@JetBlue I can't call right now. My baby just fell asleep.
@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?
@USAirways 2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue...
@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
@AmericanAir first the pilot, then the catering...
@USAirways Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher?

@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?

@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
@AmericanAir we're still stucked in the airport. #AADelay #AA919
@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
@SouthwestAir is it possible to book a refundable trip? Willing to pay extra. This would be for a domestic round trip flight
@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you.
@united When will you have special promotions for flights departing Newark, NJ to St. John's, Antigua?

@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy

@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
@SouthwestAir When are you going to be flying in and out of Nashville? The Deicer is in. Are you short on planes and is it tomorrow morning?
@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
@USAirways No, this is a systemic problem. Mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but USAirways SPF record disallows it. DM me for more detail
@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
@united this is me and my partners first trip to #NYC I bought the tickets at the same time Please seat us next to each other ConF# ILC0HP

@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
@JetBlue deal!
@united My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm needing some help reFlight Booking Problems.
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
@AmericanAir drop me a follow I need help
@USAirways I already HAVE, four times
@AmericanAir i want to change my flight for next week, they will still charge me. Waiting for fligt status
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.
@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it...

@AmericanAir speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
@SouthwestAir I will be writing in about the service via email. My company also transports well over 100 clients monthly via SW.
@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
@JetBlue I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
@AmericanAir no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated
@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
@JetBlue Thanks for having us hang out at Tampa Airport forever today!!! It's really been an awesome experience
@USAirways 100 feet from the gate at PHL, but no ground crew. You can't make this up.
@AmericanAir delayed.....wow
@AmericanAir two Cancelled Flightled LGA flights. Both by @Delta took off. Looks like I have a new carrier @Delta!
‚Äú@VirginAmerica:You've met your match.Got status on another airline? Upgrade : http://t.co/H952rDKTqy‚Äù @asarco_ES_ar ? üôâ
@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
@JetBlue great flight! Great view! :-) http://t.co/Yxn00pnOav
@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@SouthwestAir There is no way that I am getting back on a plane with your airline. I will be calling to get a refund. As I drive 17 hrs home
@SouthwestAir can take u to Midway-Chicago March 8th-April 6th. Can't make it then? @AmericanAir can get u to @fly2ohare year round. #FlyPBI
@AmericanAir I paid extra $ for my seat &amp; the monitor didn't work from on AA111. How about a refund on the seat? Conf #: MDBEEI, McMullen
@USAirways car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications
@united Flight 1640 (N33289) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @iah http://t.co/RvCDA2nnme
@AmericanAir what is the status of flight 1675 tomorrow
@VirginAmerica plz help me win my bid upgrade for my flight 2/27 LAX---&gt;SEA!!!  üç∑üëçüí∫‚úàÔ∏è
@USAirways no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm
@united your customer service is terrible
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
@USAirways what about AA miles for USAir flights booked through American?
@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
@united service staff to is less than friendly!
@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
@united Hi if a premium ec upgrade was paid for &amp; then a mileage BF upgrade done is the prem Eco upgrade fare refunded?
@SouthwestAir PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :(
@SouthwestAir Thank You. We'll be in touch! #MoveAboutTheCountry
@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ
@SouthwestAir did anyone come into work today? u should have all the pilots and flight attendants answer phones if no one is flying
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?
@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
@SouthwestAir, been on hold for an over an hour now - when can we expect some customer service? #disappointed
@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
@USAirways what's going on with passengers diverted to CLT on FLL to PHL flight that left at 830 tonight?
@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly üò•
@SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here.
@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/fW3cy8HGdJ
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
@SouthwestAir I never got a Cancelled Flightlation text from this morning either #bushleague or a number to call #weakservice
@SouthwestAir When do you all expect to open the reservation through November?
@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
@AmericanAir please dm me
@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
@JetBlue Btw, thanks for responding quickly!!
@AmericanAir Lets hope it stays that way.Big thanks to your ground/outside crews all across the US the last month. Great FB post yesterday.
@USAirways no your not!
@united will I make it with the delay?
@SouthwestAir Making Miracles again! The customer service department gave me by far one of the friendliest phone calls ever. #wheelsup
@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
@JetBlue and @WSJ team up offering in-flight access to journal content http://t.co/PTsbkA4cDJ
@AmericanAir I have an issue that requires a bit more than a tweet to explain, do y‚Äôall have an email?
@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
@AmericanAir  that's what I am hoping for
@AmericanAir if I could fly an md80/dc10 I would be so happy I live that plane so much md80 is love md80 is life.
@JetBlue When chging flight, isit possible to pay the fare difference in dollars when the ticket was bought completely via point redemption?
@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer.
@SouthwestAir thanks for an awesome flight and connection! We were delayed but your staff and crew were purely amazing!
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your "fine print," haha
@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad.
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
@SouthwestAir customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear
@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
@SouthwestAir @tbuccheriFRNC3E. It takes 13.5 hours to fly from Chicago to Beijing on United, and 12 to fly from Vegas to Omaha on SW...
@SouthwestAir yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday
@SouthwestAir I told myself last time I would never fly you again. I really messed up today. Thanks flight 1802. Worst airline ever
@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
@AmericanAir I've been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up?
@SouthwestAir very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing
@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
@AmericanAir oh I will, AA on speed dial
@AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outragedüò°üò°
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
@JetBlue yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy
@VirginAmerica got it squared away. Someone picked up as soon as I tweeted. Should have tweeted sooner. üòâ
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
@USAirways Huge system problems at DCA.Manual check in; flight boarded but sitting at gate due to system issues. Frustrated Chairman member
@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir think flight 1945 from BNA to LAX will get off the ground tomorrow??? #please #snowbama
@JetBlue with 3 kids and 11 days 340 + doesn't work and it's months in advance
@united Life goal: complete ‚úîÔ∏è
@SouthwestAir -U dont have Atlanta to San fransisco in 99$ in the present sale, like u had in the last sale?Im looking for 2 return tickets
@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
@JetBlue if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising.
@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless
@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@united Thank you!! üòä
@JetBlue I flew on a flight about 3 months ago. Me and my girlfriend got away with having sex in a restroom. Is it allowed now?
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@JetBlue thanks so much. Can't wait to fly with you guys :)
@AmericanAir LGA 2 Nashville Cancelled Flightled phone center no help. Fabulous staff at gate D4 helped-2 young men handled crowd well.
@united "We like hearing from you." So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi
@SouthwestAir Have a cup coffee and relax while you check out the New Deals and Promotions at Avon, twice a month at Doug @dcoadavon
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@USAirways your service at PHL is abysmal. An hour on the runway waiting for a gate, no information anywhere, missed my connection abysmal!
@SouthwestAir sign me up!
@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us.
@JetBlue Spent most of the winter in NNY with Mom,  JetBlue will take me home to FL via BOS on Mon. Miss hubby, kitties, warm #countingdown
@SouthwestAir Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!
@USAirways TYVM USAir, Happy Night@ &lt;3
@JetBlue can u see what's holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
@SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
@USAirways - I wouldn't need to wait on hold for 6+ hours if your website worked correctly - please respond!
@SouthwestAir what do I need to do when TSA pre doesn't show for a flight of mine?
@united Flight 280
@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so.
@SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me
@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
@USAirways had to Cancelled Flight 4 of my flights because my versace biceps wouldn't stow completely under the seat in front of me.
@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30
@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags

@USAirways website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there
@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
@SouthwestAir how many left?! I'm 15 min wway
@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
@JetBlue @KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a
@united I did not.  That's why I am VERY concerned.
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
@USAirways @AmericanAir First Class all the way!!üí∫‚úàÔ∏è Headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kDMq0jps02
@USAirways If I‚Äôm unable to use my departing flight can I still use the returning flight?

@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event

@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@USAirways so I can make a reservation
@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@SouthwestAir 2 1/2 hours Late Flight, but I made it to sf! Maybe you can help me get on an earlier flight on Sunday :)
@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?
@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
@JetBlue this feels nice - what we've got going on here. Let's just swap me out with the fool in 5a and we can make it all better.
@USAirways Everyone on Flight 669 from LAX to RDU enjoyed waiting an hour &amp; a half in baggage claim for their bags just now
@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
@AmericanAir My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?
@AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?  No info....

@SouthwestAir just had a great flight #4223 with Damion! He was the best #damionflight4223
@VirginAmerica you have the absolute best team and customer service ever.  Every time I fly with you I'm delighted.  Thank you!
@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS
@USAirways Its not just PHL, at BTV today made to deplane because "it's Sunday and we don't know if maintenance will be available"
@USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly
@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to"arrange pick up"in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!
@AmericanAir absolutely worse cust. Svc ever experienced in 25 yrs of flying.  Supvrs at iah extremely rude. #poorservice #travel
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
@JetBlue Any EMS window seats on 1099 tomorrow?
@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho.
@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told "we can't find a supervisor."
@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
@VirginAmerica it‚Äôs just a bug report, guys
@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
C'mon, this is worse than JetBae. RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. https://t.co/yZXfe7au22
@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
@USAirways 502 M-phx Im still on The plane waiting And waiting
@USAirways - what is your policy regarding large-size passengers who cannot fit into a single coach class seat?
@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
@JetBlue heading to Buffalo... trading the cold in Boston for colder in Buffalo... Maybe the Caribbean next time?
@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
Thanks! Hope I don't look like a complainer, I've written of good experiences w/you in the past and am making do in terminal 5 :) @JetBlue
@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
@AmericanAir What's the best way to check on any delays or Cancelled Flightlations for my flight out of DFW on Tuesday?
@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
@united so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?
@united Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!

@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
@JetBlue is the trueblue site broken at the moment?
@AmericanAir Thanks, both airlines said that it is located at AA Detroit. Also was informed that it flew with AA, which shouldn't matter.
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I always tell everyone to fly Southwest! Congratulations!!!
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier
@AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection!
@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too

@SouthwestAir @karajusto SWA is willing to follow up. FINALLY.
.@AmericanAir ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
@AmericanAir crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably
@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
@USAirways and I would have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and say we misunderstood each other until he went on a
@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
@SouthwestAir  I look forward to those direct flights to California to see my family more often. Thank you @MichaelBColeman #byebyeusairline
@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
@SouthwestAir Yes! How about #DestinationDragons in San Diego?!?
@united yes, a paper voucher that I got on January 26th 2015
@usairways  my flight has been Cancelled Flightled. On hold for 2+ hrs to reschedule. Need help now.  Taking way too long http://t.co/NeHnsDCkTY
@AmericanAir thanks
@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
@USAirways I need help. In air on #717 to CLT from PHL. Conf: D1MQF5 Need confirmed on #1776 to BNA at 10:30. Been bumped all day, need home
@JetBlue I'm all set. About to fly. Not bad for a first date with a giant metal bird machine. She even brought snacks.
@JetBlue I just wanted to say flight attendant fitz was the best tonight on flight #1326 bwi/Bos. Great guy and made the flight fantastic!
@AmericanAir is there not an email address I can send my issue to? you guys screwed up and rebooked my flight to the wrong day!  please help
@SouthwestAir beautiful day in Seattle! http://t.co/iqu0PPVq2S
@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i "have" to fly with you.
@USAirways @AmericanAir 9 empty seats open in 1st on AA1061. No upgrades for a U.S. Gold member? Would love consistent policies.
@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates
@USAirways Can't wait for the trip. Thanks for getting me there!
@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations.
@JetBlue last sleep in Cali... back to JFK tomorrow night.  Looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all :)
@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
@SouthwestAir greetings
@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else
@USAirways @AmericanAir I love you guys &amp; I'm gonna let you finish, but I've been on hold for 1 hour trying to book a flight w/ my voucher.

@AmericanAir Sorry, what equipment? Have the passengers been allowed to return to the plane?
@USAirways My brother &amp; his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather
@JetBlue Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can't find 471 or 472 anywhere
@VirginAmerica add DTW and I'm sold!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta...
@VirginAmerica to jump into the #Dallas #Austin market http://t.co/SzR0pioA21
@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours.
@JetBlue @drwinston001 I think we'll need a selfie as proof...
@united no I don't, but I'm sure United have my info on its system.
@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault.
@united question - was given food vouchers but can't use on plane..how   come
@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
@united how come it's cheaper to fly to BKK than NRT even though to get to BKK you take an extra flight, from NRT!
@united followed you and DM'd you
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@JetBlue does not fit in 140
@USAirways  Flight 4454 aircraft at gate, but no crew?  Will be 2+ hours Late Flight to destination. Come on!
@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address.
@AmericanAir I will and I will share with many, many others. #filmcrew #media @WSJ @nytimes @latimes @chicagotribune
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!
@USAirways 4473.  She just called to say it's a runway clearing problem of all things.
@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks
@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
YASSSSS. Da Fuccc- RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/oAJ5mnuchA
@USAirways thanks for Cancelled Flighting flight 5097 today. Now missing required training. Not a happy customer.
@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
@SouthwestAir were you handing out tickets while I was sleep ?
@AmericanAir guarantee no retribution? If so, I'd be glad to share.
@USAirways Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow.
@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
@Jetblue Delay = Perfect time to learn Swift programming with @TeamTreehouse
@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons any info on #DestinationDragons ?? me &amp; @sammi_jon3s need to know..
@SouthwestAir not yet! Supposed to get it early evening tonight. Don't want to have to go to the store and buy new necessities.
@SouthwestAir Any chance there's a few seats open from DEN to DAL this afternoon?
@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.
@JetBlue Thanks for the quick reply! Just wanted to make sure it wasn't just my account :)
@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter
@VirginAmerica you have amazing staff &amp; super helpful as I just ran the @WaltDisneyWorld #PrincessHalf they have spoiled me with comfort!!!
@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU for finally making your boarding passes work with passbook
@AmericanAir a school trip of 38 including myself had to sleep over in the airport and are all on different standby flights.This is not good
@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
@USAirways all these planes sitting here and no one going home. #usairwaysfail http://t.co/jN3V3k3qGv
@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
@SouthwestAir - I just had a great experience with your customer service team. Thank you! #LuvSW A-list
@JetBlue the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 üò©
@USAirways that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away...
@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick "Goodbye" Very Sad!
@SouthwestAir at troubadour with @Imaginedragons .#DestinationDragons http://t.co/rKlQXXaWhc
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of "Whiplash" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@SouthwestAir My flight to KC has been Cancelled Flighted and the next available isn't till Tuesday?! What am I supposed to do for 3 nights?????
@USAirways Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
@USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped
.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter
@SouthwestAir has a beautiful fleet. What a perfect evening to fly! http://t.co/XMZ3Tf9Ix8
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
@USAirways why cant Sapphire members reach anyone on the phone?
@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help
@SouthwestAir you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
@USAirways took me 4+ hours to book flights yesterday due to system errors between you and @AmericanAir. paid $320 extra due to time lapse
@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.
@AmericanAir I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or @abc7newsBayArea please help!
@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!
@SouthwestAir When does PV get approved? I am ready to go!!

@united I DM'd child's birthdate and full name.
‚Äú@united: @ItsAaronChriz Sorry to hear about your flight. Do you need help reFlight Booking Problems?‚Äù

üëé
@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
@united There is only one club at LAX  - in terminal 7 across from gate 71
@AmericanAir lovely flight back from MIA to LHR - great crew - thanks :-))
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice
@JetBlue where did my travel bank credit go?  I can't call you right now.
@united airlines.

@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in.
@USAirways Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!
@AmericanAir followed. I tried to @USAirways record locator number, gave me an error code
@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
@AmericanAir and feel free to email me mikehertz7@gmail.com - don't worry, we're not going anywhere but this damn Tarmac for a bit!
@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?
@SouthwestAir @jlittle100 Double up with this comment. PHL to anywhere South Florida is GONE GONE GONE. Hello US Air
@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
@SouthwestAir Please get back with my about my airtran credit Q4VNMB, I call and I'm being told that I will, but I never get email/call back
@SouthwestAir suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around
@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?
@SouthwestAir using social business roadmap to develop intelligent path to embed social across enterprise #RaganDisney
@SouthwestAir @ LAX is almost a mess. For some reason the express bag drop is slower than the full service line. http://t.co/ORY89eEGek
@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@SouthwestAir had to Cancelled Flight my flight because my Cavalli calves was interfering with the onboard equipment.
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood  I'm Lady Gaga!!! She is amazing! üòä
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@USAirways at least they make you run so you want yo buy this fresh diet coke...nice bizness plan. Its all about marketing right?

@JetBlue time to reevaluate my nyc carrier.
@USAirways My bags were supposed to be delivered to NYC last night (missing since Thurs) but are not here. Can someone call me?
@SouthwestAir yep after two hours and thirty minutes
@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?
@JetBlue thank you very very much!! üíôüíô
@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
@SouthwestAir my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30
@USAirways  glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. Sad for others who didn't get back bc of scheduling problems.
@SouthwestAir right but the point was that my kids don't fly often, but I do. I bought four round trip tickets from DtW to PHX so I'm....
@JetBlue can you tweet #closepwcs to get the word out?üò¢
@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
@NinaDavuluri We think it's a treat to have you onboard! Enjoy your flight. üíô
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@SouthwestAir first time flying with you. You've definitely won me over!
@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
@SouthwestAir thankyou :))‚ù§Ô∏è
@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!
@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD
@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@SouthwestAir Awesome staff at the  check in desk! They had a paper airplane race for a SW gift card to keep ppl entertained during delays
I just need a place to sleep when I land without accommodations in PLS @AmericanAir!
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
@USAirways after 5 flight Cancelled Flightlations we finally get a flight, get to the gate on time &amp; you've given our seats away? Seriously??
@AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK
@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
@AmericanAir I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven't heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information!
@AmericanAir You guys are the talk of the Americans down here in Ecuador! Read this! https://t.co/5ON3KlzVMT
@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL.
@SouthwestAir  also, gave up after 1 hr 32 minutes on hold. Maybe put a few more people on it?
@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@AmericanAir now you change my gate and don't tell me? What the fuck is wrong with you people. Learn to do your fucken job
@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
@united sent
@VirginAmerica I need a receipt for a flight change. Can you send one?
@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there‚Äôs no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@VirginAmerica thanks guys! Sweet route over the Rockies #airplanemodewason

@JetBlue word thanks
@SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
@AmericanAir I need to change a ticket and my res can't be changed online.  I also can't get a call through due to high volume--can u help?
@JetBlue thanks for getting me to Boston early for @TuftsEnergyConf "Breaking Barriers To a Clean Energy Future"
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.

@SouthwestAir @AmericanAir y'all are better then @united
@VirginAmerica can you please have flights in  SJC ? I have no choice but to fly Southwest to Vegas üò©üò≠
@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@USAirways Thank you!!! This whole crew has rocked through bad weather and diversion. Pilot keeping us well informed. #customerservice
@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
@united yes. Houston Int'l, Bush.
@AmericanAir its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
@JetBlue my mom wanted me to change her seat along with my sister, but their two different reservations and idk
@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united speaking of my flight, skateboards are allowed as carry on bagage right? No extra payment needed?
@USAirways we flew out, through and into good weather. when we landed,  another technical issue with gate. improve service or lose customers
@JetBlue Thanks for the instant reply, and for still doing first bag free (so important)!
@AmericanAir Can I use an SWU on an Finnair codeshare of an American operated flight (JFK-MAN)?  Thanks in advance for the help!
@USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service
Number or email? That's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways
@AmericanAir
 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag.
@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
@JetBlue is I can't make changes on the website am I still charged 25 dollars for using phone
@united is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited
@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat
@SouthwestAir pleasantly surprised to be boarding my flight on time this morning at @Fly_Nashville. Good job!
@JetBlue status of flight 684 from MCO to LGA tomorrow?
@USAirways let's say it's directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less!
@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
@SouthwestAir Thanks. I'll keep checking. I'm trying to book our first Disney World vacation.
@USAirways Past tense re help. No more. It‚Äôs been even more miserable than usual at CLT.

@SouthwestAir safety back in Dallas!
@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying

@AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS
@JetBlue That's right! :) Game, set, match.
@united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks

@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
I've been trying to set up my phone interview for days, and hoping the position won't be filled because the link doesn't work. @USAirways
@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief.
@united DM the conf # to you - did you receive it?
@AmericanAir #epicfail on connections in #Chicago today, extremely disappointed w/ unaccommodating customer service, rethinking loyalty üòê
@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem.

@JetBlue well mine sure aren't anything to write home about!
@USAirways so you strand my bag in Philly last Sat and strand me in Philly this Sat. thanks for the bullshit.
@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer!
@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.

@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow

@USAirways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways
@SouthwestAir Oh no worries NL, no disappointments here. Better to have NO lounges than like #Delta who has them but does disappoint!
@SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
@AmericanAir 

Fantastic support by the Twitter team. I appreciate it. Thanks again.
@AmericanAir I love the service and cheap upgrades American Provides! One of the best airlines ever! good food, good seats, amazing thanks!

@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate.
@SouthwestAir Was on hold for 2 hours before you disconnected me after my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Swell company, you.
@VirginAmerica still waiting to see  @Starryeyes_Dev_  üòû
@JetBlue No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed.
@USAirways Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation?
@JetBlue Aw okay thanks
@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
@united will do. Thank you!
@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting
@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that

@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@JetBlue üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ yall are really better then American Airlines though.
@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
@USAirways a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?üòë
@united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip.
@VirginAmerica help, left expensive headphones on flight 89 IAD to LAX today. Seat 2A. No one answering L&amp;F number at LAX!
@AmericanAir Yes, thank you. Just not how I wanted to start my vacation!
@VirginAmerica Grand Budapest Hotel #OscarsCountdown
@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic.
@JetBlue they couldn't do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8
@JetBlue Very excited, for the first time this Sunday, March 1 I get to fly #JetBlue flight 123 #Mint from JFK. Looking forward :-)
@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
@USAirways the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@SouthwestAir What an awesome flight Dallas 2 NY. Virgin America refused bc of my child's peanut allergy but u guys didn't. Thanks! üëçüòä
@SouthwestAir thanks for your excellent response time and assistance! All set :)
@JetBlue If you'd love to see more girls be inspired about becoming pilots, RT our free WOAW event March 2-8 at ABQ. http://t.co/rfXlV1kGDh

@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
@AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
@SouthwestAir  been on hold  for 2 1/2 hrs. Can't get 2 airport 4 flight icy country backroads! Help pls? @SouthwestAir  #BNA
@USAirways Thanks guys! Got hold of someone. Really awesome service I appreciate it :)
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare}
@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
@USAirways What is happening? Have been sitting in Philly for hours. Pls take care of Flight 759 to Chicago. At least least us know! #soLate Flight
.@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're "watching" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars
@AmericanAir when will the merging of miles between you and @USAirways be complete? Wasn't it this month?
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 2 hours!  When will you answer??
@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
@JetBlue if my flight says delayed with estimated departure listed, can I arrive at airport Late Flightr?
@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.
@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.
@VirginAmerica, the only airline based in Silicon Valley! #disruption #FCmostinnovative #incubator  @FastCompany's http://t.co/wU3LbCNcr9
@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
@VirginAmerica Is flight 769 on it's way? Was supposed to take off 30 minutes ago. Website still shows "On Time" not "In Flight". Thanks.
@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
@USAirways i did and i'm not stupid. i've done web development for 19 yrs. the issue (now confirmed by your support) is YOUR website.
@JetBlue where is the "award winning service"?
@JetBlue well our plane just landed at the international terminal... so they announced the 10 pm new time.
@VirginAmerica hold times at call center are a bit much
@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
@SouthwestAir sent
@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
@USAirways question, friend flight got Cancelled Flightled. How can he book be flight? Leaving CHS to Philly to Germany
@JetBlue any chance you will by this summer?
@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim!
@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT.
@SouthwestAir just DMed you guys!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
@SouthwestAir props to your LAS employees working C11 gate. Because of them I am not opposed to flying through or to LAS in the future! üëèüëèüëè
@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.
@JetBlue Just got the time to reply and share my thoughts in greater detail via web form.
@virginamerica Well, I didn't‚Ä¶but NOW I DO! :-D
@united Did you get your 757 Model?
@JetBlue you guys are lucky I love you
@JetBlue extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives?
@USAirways your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. I appreciate the hard work &amp; the push to b better
@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
@SouthwestAir all good now. Going to make it to Boston on time. I'm actually on your wifi right now
@SouthwestAir He is going to file a formal complaint, this should have never happened. Please direct us to the right department.
@united it's amazing really.
@SouthwestAir Today is going to be the day, I can feel it!  Thank y'all for your support throughout! We're coming home Nashville! #Octavia
@united give me an email address and I'll send the actually screen shot to you.
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@USAirways CSTSVC in PHL honors UR system over my reality. No RCD of change in HPN. Now extra hours in PHL or $75 to get to CLE.
@SouthwestAir why am I still in Baltimore?! @delta is doing laps around us and laughing about it. # ridiculous
@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
@SouthwestAir LOST Kay Chapman Designs art-luggage for important show. Won't help locate it. Terrible customer service.
@SouthwestAir Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room.
@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@AmericanAir I tried to check in, but they redirect me to call in to @USAirways, which I also can't get into contact with
@AmericanAir Are you expecting delays/Cancelled Flightlations at Dallas on 25/26th due to the snow? Nothing like Monday I hope!
@JetBlue tell the truth - this is a pic of your social media community managers isn't it? http://t.co/e2AXlqzWvh
@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable.
@SouthwestAir I'm just calling to Cancelled Flight a flight. I already rebooked it on another card. Just need to Cancelled Flight the previous reservation.
@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?
@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
@JetBlue I would fly to Washington  DC to see the actual Constitution  and the Declaration of Independence, in honor of a US Navy friend.
@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
@JetBlue Thx for the pointer, but Im good with the big monitor.  Any advice on who I should pick to come our of the Western Conf (NBA)?
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
@SouthwestAir can I get some luv with a fallow?
@usairways on hold for TWO HOURS now, pick up the PHONEEEEE
@SouthwestAir Can my wife's RR points be transferred to my RR account?
@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon?
@SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar.
@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
@JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm
@JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
@AmericanAir As I already have a booked flight that I can't use &amp; can't change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2
@AmericanAir Please follow me.
@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
@united thnx
@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying..
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
@JetBlue if i ask ask the pilot will he tell me the name of our aiecraft
@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours...
@JetBlue ‚Äôs Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw
@JetBlue you guys need live chat.
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@USAirways Yes, I get that. I‚Äôm asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I‚Äôve given you?
@united "Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"
@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I‚Äôll ride US for life
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
@JetBlue thank you for incredible customer svc from gate to flight. Mint experience is magic.
@AmericanAir so how do we get me a person?
@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
@JetBlue I wish you all the best of luck :-) I'm enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space rn. Thanks
@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. üòí
@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)
@JetBlue To DC this summer and help local youth get ready to return to school with math refresher courses. #FlyItForward

@SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr!
@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA

@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?
@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?
@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service
@united I got an email saying "changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed" but I didn't make any changes. Help?
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
@united at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees

@USAirways your customer service is atrocious.
@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup
@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
@AmericanAir should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... http://t.co/4SFpcbyy9m

@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)

@JetBlue This is how you have me feeling.... http://t.co/esUu0hiAjM

@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
@SouthwestAir unfortunately no, it's my lack of status that's the big problem. My company policy forces me to buy the cheapest tickets

@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
@AmericanAir if you could get the gate crew to help us off FLT 5350 that would be great....
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
@SouthwestAir luckily, the people working the BSO at Chicago Midway have been very attentive and found our bags in Punta Cana.
@USAirways 4 hrs and counting today alone... like I don't have other things to accomplish today than to just keep holding!!!
@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
@VirginAmerica thank you for the easy itinerary shift for impending weather. Quick, painless &amp; free.
@AmericanAir can you take care @Cowboycerrone please.  Thanks
@JetBlue Inconvenience is an understatement. More like torture. Clearly going down the wrong path, JetBlue.
@USAirways You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection.
@USAirways nope not yet...
@SouthwestAir So far so good! http://t.co/16c9ex79Rk
@SouthwestAir @CBSsoxfan you get to hold? called twice only to be kicked off.calls 3-6 #phonedied #AListpreferred http://t.co/1TZZ0vbMbS
@JetBlue Really!? That's good to hear! Thanks for the update @walls29 We may make that business meeting after all.
@JetBlue trying to charge us $550 dollars cash for tickets we paid for months in advance #isthisreal #nevertoldus #jetblue #NeverAgain
@USAirways can u tell me if 5238 from clt to Jan has gotten out of the gate yet?  I will have a tight connection out of clt to mco.
@USAirways Your customer service is  non-existent/ terrible. Dozens waiting for bags not placed on our flight, no staff anywhere #neveragain
@SouthwestAir Whoa. Thanks and that's what I wanted to hear! Early flight coming up. Thanks for the reply.
@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
@USAirways Just contaced EYEWITNESS NEWS about the ripoff the Cancelled Flighted now they want me to pay
@SouthwestAir thx. Make it right. Help Meagan Fouty Brancato fl#2771 dfw gate 4 preboard w/kids - b4 group A please. Please.
@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags
@united your "Airserv" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity.
@SouthwestAir @taylormdowns We share that value in common. :)
@USAirways on hold now over 2 hrs on one phone hung on 5 x on another? How do you reach a person? No weather condition makes this excusable!
@AmericanAir the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
@SouthwestAir how do I get my companion pass?
@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour
@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
@USAirways Been stuck for 40+ minutes due to lavatory issues. No beverages. No snacks. No customer service. Flt 645 to PHO... #fail #refund
@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.
Nice RT @VirginAmerica: The man of steel might be faster, but we have WiFi ‚Äì just saying. #ScienceBehindTheExperience http://t.co/FGRbpAZSiX
